  <h1>Nobunaga - Main - Romantic & Dramatic Full Love Bonus</h1>

<h2>The Devil King's Favorite Sweets</h2>
<p>...As evening fell, I came to a dire realization. This was an emergency.
<p>I summoned my greatest warlords to the audience chamber to aid me in dealing with it.
<p>(Good. They're all here. I only hope it's not too late.)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "My lord, you mentioned an emergency. What is this about?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Could it be? Has there been word of another revolt?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "No. This is far more serious."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Perhaps there's some nefarious activity going on in the fiefs?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I doubt it. We would have heard about it if that was the case."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Masamune is correct. It is not that either."
<p>(Those things pale in comparison to this.)
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Can you just tell us?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC has stopped speaking to me."
<p>The shocked looks on everyone's faces spoke volumes.
<p>They understood how grave this matter was as well.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga... is that the emergency?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes."
<p>(This requires immediate action.)
<p>They were all speechless. I couldn't blame them. Even I was unable to hide my worry.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will listen to any suggestions. This standoff must end."
<p>Masamune was the first to speak. Rather, instead of speaking, he laughed.
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I knew the lass had moxie! I've never seen anyone have our lord in a vice like that."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I'll admit, she's something."
<p>(Why do I think they're not taking this seriously?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It's no laughing matter. MC hasn't spoken to me in three whole days."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "This has never happened before."
<p>(I haven't seen her smile once since this began.)
<p>(I'm starting to believe this could prove fatal.)
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Um, can I go?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Leaving is forbidden."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "If we are forced to stay, then... let's see."
<p>Crossing his arms, Mitsunari looked at me with a serious expression.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "You said she hasn't spoken to you in three days. Did anything happen between you two at that time that could have caused this?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I can't think of anything."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...I've got it!"
<p>Hideyoshi, who had been concentrating hard as well, suddenly spoke up.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga, I know what caused this."
<p>(What?!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Is that true, Hideyoshi?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Yes, my lord. As you'll recall, three days ago we held a banquet to honor the vassals."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "And MC was there too."
<p>(Of course she was. I hate being away from her.)
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Riiiight. I see where Hideyoshi's coming from."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "It's all starting to make sense."
<p>(What are they talking about?)
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "You're right, Lord Hideyoshi. In all probability, that has to be it."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Now that I know what this is about, I really, really want to leave."
<p>(What do they all know? Why won't they tell me?)
<p>I was irritated that the matter remained a mystery to me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hideyoshi. In plain words, explain what is going on?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "It's that group of entertainers we hired, my lord. They're the cause."
<p>(It's still not making sense to me.)
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "You don't remember how popular you were with those dancing girls? They showered you with affection."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "And I remember MC frowning from that point on, until the banquet ended."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "I think I saw her make a fist each time they poured you wine."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I still don't understand."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga, the dear girl is jealous. She is experiencing a snit."
<p>(Jealous? Why?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC shouldn't be jealous."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I would never take another woman as my partner now that I have her."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Of course, we all know that. And I'm sure MC knows too."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "The head can understand something, but that doesn't mean the heart will go along."
<p>(Is that so?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Now that I know, I will go and talk to MC."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Can we hear what you plan to tell her, first?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "'Jealousy is a needless waste of time. Now cease this foolishness!' That is what I am going to say."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "M-my lord, pardon me for saying so, but that would probably make matters worse."
<p>(He sounds very certain about that.)
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Get her a gift. That'll cheer her up."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "A gift. I see."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Don't get her anything too fancy! She'll think you've done something really bad and are feeling guilty about it."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Excellent advice, Hideyoshi. Is that how you've kept your popularity with the ladies?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Mitsuhide, that compliment, if it was a compliment, made me feel a little ill."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I believe even a small gift, as long as it came from you, would be meaningful to her."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Get her candy. I bet she'll fall all over you if you get her something sweet."
<p>(I see. Candy to sweeten her mood. That makes sense.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then that is what I shall do."
<p>At once, my men instantly looked relieved.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Thank you, everyone. You've been of great service to me."
<p>(Now, I need to prepare.)
<p>Fueled with determination, I stood and left the audience chamber behind.
<p>Once Nobunaga was out of sight, the remaining men exchanged haggard looks.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "That was our lord, right? The same man who can lead a charge into the enemy camp without batting an eye?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "I think the real emergency is figuring out if there's something in the sake. And if the rest of you are next."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I like seeing him show a couple of flaws."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I do too. It may be discorteous of me to say, but I'm actually relieved."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "To be honest, me too."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "It took a woman like MC to get Lord Nobunaga to finally panic."
<p>The men silently acknowledged that being part of Nobunaga's emotional support group was now one of their duties.
<p>Though none of them, or at least few, found this particularly disagreeable.
<p>......
<p>(Good. MC is still awake.)
<p>Returning to the tenshu, I smiled when I saw her.
<p>She was sitting beside the lamp, sewing. She looked deep in concentration.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I've returned."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Welcome ba--"
<p>(Could it be?)
<p>But MC had cut herself off the second she saw me.
<p>She clicked her tongue and looked the other direction.
<p>(She's still in quite a bad mood.)
<p>(But that ends tonight.)
<p>I approached MC and sat down before her. She still refused to look at me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, here."
<p>I opened an ornate glass box and produced a small, colorful sugar candy.
<p>She frowned at it, but I could tell there was a glimmer of curiosity in her eyes.
<p>I offered her the candy. Finally, she took it and placed it in her mouth.
<p>MC's frown melted even as she crunched down on the treat.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...That's candy. That's real candy!"
<p>(She said something!)
<p>The ache that had settled in my heart these last three days lifted at those words.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes. It's a gift for you, MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "A gift, huh?"
<p>I offered her the box, filled with sugar candies, that I had purchased from a foreign trader.
<p>MC looked at me with a calculating expression.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Why are you giving me a gift? You did something really bad, didn't you?"
<p>(Hideyoshi's advice was right on the mark!)
<p>(I'll commend him later.)
<p>But to my horror, MC's expression grew darker.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No answer? Feeling guilty, huh?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I didn't do anything I feel guilty about. At least, I didn't do whatever it is you think I did."
<p>(I only have eyes for you. Always.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I'm giving you the candy so that I can see you smile. I can't be happy when you're unhappy."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "When you're sad, my heart hurts."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga, you--"
<p>(I believe she told me something similar in the past.)
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Are people not allowed to worry about you? Maybe I should send a memo to Hideyoshi!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I don't see why YOU worry about me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Do you want me to go down the list?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You saved my life, what, four times now?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You know Nobunaga, this may surprise you but I'm happy when you're happy."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And when you're sad, I'm sad. So what I'm saying is--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's my choice if I want to be worried about you!"
<p>......
<p>(Back then, I didn't know what she was talking about.)
<p>(I dismissed what she said, wondering why it would even concern her.)
<p>(But I understand now. That feeling can't be ignored--it's overwhelming.)
<p>MC's pain became my pain. Her joy became mine too.
<p>It wasn't a conscious thought. It was internal, physical.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Were you not talking to me because you were jealous?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "The truth is... yes. I was jealous!"
<p>MC looked down, blushing.
<p>(So it's true.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Mitsuhide called it accurately."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Uh, you talked to Mitsuhide about this?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Not just him. I was going to tell you jealousy was pointless, but Hideyoshi stopped me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Masamune advised me to get you a gift."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Mitsunari suggested something small, and Ieyasu something sweet."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wait wait wait wait."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You told EVERYONE about this?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes. I gathered everyone together to discuss how to improve your mood."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I can't believe it."
<p>(They provided me with an excellent solution. I will definitely seek out their advice in the future.)
<p>I crossed my arms in satisfaction, but MC buried her face in her hands.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I can't even imagine what they're all thinking right now."
<p>(She's upset again!)
<p>But MC laughed. The sound of it was so sweet it nearly broke my heart.
<p>Her cheerful voice tinkled like a bell.
<p>(Finally, I can hear her laugh again.)
<p>(...She's laughing a lot.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Why are you still laughing?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Because you called a WAR COUNCIL after I gave you the silent treatment for a few days! It's just so ridiculous, and--"
<p>(What's so strange about that? I keep them for their wise counsil. Well, no, she may have a point.)
<p>(Perhaps the surprising things she says have more truth in them than I once suspected.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I really didn't expect you to get me candy."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It was a poor choice?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Not at all! It's delicious! I didn't even know you could get candy."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I don't suppose you know about chocolate?"
<p>(I will have to see about that. As for the candy, I'm pleased, because--)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "To be honest, I got them for you because I like them too."
<p>Smiling, she held the box out to me.
<p>I took a candy and popped it into my mouth.
<p>The flavor of the sugar rolled over my tongue. I crunched the tiny, spiky drop in my teeth.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "These are my favorite. I'm very fond of them."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay, that's so cute!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I don't normally like my food sweet, but I often crave these."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Your reputation would suggest the opposite!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I know. And that's why I only indulge in private."
<p>(The sight of me eating sugar candy shocks people. And somehow, that ruins it for me.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "The thought of you saving up little treats to eat in your room--!"
<p>MC laughed again, looking happy, and took another candy.
<p>(She's back to herself.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You're smiling again."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I'm glad this is something we can enjoy together."
<p>Our gazes locked and I moved closer to her. We shared another treat.
<p>MC gave me a warm look.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Can I say, I love that you have a sweet tooth?"
<p>(Is that why she's smiling?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You have this secret adorable side that I can't resist."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I know people say a lot of things about you, but the truth is you're just a cutie."
<p>(A... cutie?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I don't feel that's an apt description at all."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You're the cutie."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nope, sorry. The real cutie is absolutely my teddy bear and candy-loving Devil King."
<p>The smile MC showed me was sweeter than any candy.
<p>(I'm not sure I see her logic, but maybe that's not important.)
<p>(MC is happy again.)
<p>Relieved, I reached to stroke her cheek. She leaned into my touch.
<p>Then she flung herself against me, as though she had missed me as much as [I] missed her.
<p>She cupped my face in her hands and raised her eyes to mine with a sympathetic look.
<p>(Hmm?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga?"
<p>MC spoke my name softly. Her face still rested warm against my chest.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Three days of silent treatment was too much for you. I'm sorry."
<p>(It was!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You've apologized. That's enough. It eases the torment of not having seen your smile for three whole days."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay. But you aren't allowed to let other girls get touchy-feely with you from now on."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You didn't notice the way they were hanging on you, refilling your cup, and trying to get you drunk?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I thought they were cocktail waitresses, not dancers! Anyway, it just didn't feel good."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You're my boyfriend. It's even an official title!"
<p>(MC--)
<p>(Though I don't know what a cocktail waitress is, I'm strangely pleased to know she got jealous over me.)
<p>With a surge of love for her, I pulled her closer.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I apologize too. And I swear to you I'll never let anyone other than you touch me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But you really had nothing to be jealous about."
<p>I tilted her chin up to look into my eyes.
<p>Her eyes were dark with desire, and seeing them stirred my own passion.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I didn't even notice them. Because I only have eyes for you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "In all the world, I love you alone."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I love you too."
<p>With those words, I felt truly forgiven.
<p>(She's sweet.)
<p>(So much sweeter than even sugar.)
<p>MC's smile, her voice, her body, her heart--
<p>They were the true indulgences.
<p>Faster than I could voice my desire, I was kissing her.
<p>She kissed me back, a quiet sound of pleasure escaping her lips.
<p>Catching that sound to keep in my heart, to treasure, I held her tight.
<p>For the first time in my life, I knew how sweet jealousy could taste, and how fulfilling it was to make up afterward.
<p>And I was looking forward to sharing many more "firsts" with her.
<p>(I'll never run out of things to love about her.)
<p>(I used to think there was nothing permanent in this chaotic world.)
<p>(But I discovered a small piece of sweet eternity.)
<p>(My feelings for you.)
<p>We went to the floor together, sharing each other's warmth and love. This was happiness.
<p>Yes, there were interruptions, but it was always here, waiting. Our kisses, one after another, showed me that truth.
