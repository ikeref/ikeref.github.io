  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 2 (6-10) - His POV</h1>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hmph..."
<p><strong>Cook:</strong> "U-um, my lord?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...What?"
<p><strong>Cook:</strong> "I only meant to say it will take a little bit, so perhaps you'd like to sit down?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I cannot see your hands when I am sitting. Continue cooking."
<p><strong>Cook:</strong> "Y-yes, my lord."
<p>MC had fallen unconscious yesterday. It was just before noon of the next day.
<p>I had been alerted that she had awakened. Now I stood watching the kitchen as the chef prepared her meal.
<p>(She has not eaten anything since last night. What she needs most now is nutritious food.)
<p>(...I cannot believe that doctor. She looked so sickly yet all he could say was "I can't find anything wrong with her"?)
<p>I would not let the cook fail MC has the doctor had. The man's hands shook as he finished piling her dinner tray high.
<p><strong>Cook:</strong> "It's done. I'll deliver it to Lady MC's room now."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There is no need for that."
<p><strong>Cook:</strong> "My lord?"
<p>(If she is not sick, there exists the possibility she was poisoned. And that her poisoner may try again.)
<p>(I will not let this tray out of my sight for a moment.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will carry it."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are awake, MC?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga!"
<p>When I opened the door, MC met me with a smile.
<p>(Her color appears... better than last night.)
<p>She was still in bed, but a weight in my heart lifted to see her smiling.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Is that breakfast... or rather lunch for me?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Who else would it be for?"
<p>I set the tray beside her futon. She closed her eyes and took in the scent of the dishes.
<p>(So, she has an appetite. I can only hope she shows no troubling symptoms.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I instructed the cook to prepare you the most nutritious meal possible."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Aww. Thank you for doing that."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Actually, you even came to bring it to me, which is nice, but why?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We do not know the cause of your collapse. Only by seeing to the delivery myself can I be sure it isn't poison."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Poison me? That's silly."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is not as silly as you think."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Now eat."
<p>I took a seat beside her and watched as she picked up the spoon.
<p>(She does not seem to have trouble moving her body. That is good.)
<p>(How is her sense of taste?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "If it is poison, it's tasty!"
<p>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then you still have your sense of taste. And the smell?"
<p>MC:</strong> "Everything smells normal."
<p>(The rest of her senses seem in good condition.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do you ache anywhere?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No."
<p>(No lingering symptoms then...)
<p>I tried to find relief in that, but the distress I felt last night had yet to leave me.
<p>(I cannot allow myself to rest easy now. I shall continue to look after her.)
<p>Nobunaga:</strong> "Anyone would be sore after sleeping for a day and a half. I will massage you once you have finished eating--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga."
<p>She put her spoon down and turned to face me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What?"
<p>MC gave me a somewhat helpless look before smiling at me.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm going to be all right."
<p>(What is she saying?)
<p>(She's reassuring... me?)
<p>(...Was I... No, am I... worried?)

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p>(...Was I... No, am I... worried?)
<p>I did not know. MC always understood my heart better than I.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Are you... certain you are fine?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I've only got the tiniest headache."
<p>I wasn't sure if I trusted her use of tiny or not.
<p>(The thought of anything happening to her puts my thoughts and emotions out of control.)
<p>(If this is love then... love is frightening.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then you should rest until it goes away."

<ul>
    <li>"...Tiny headache."</li>
    <li><strong>"I won't stress myself."</strong></li>
    <li>"I'll get over it."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I won't do anything strenuous, that's for sure. After all--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...My body also belongs to you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes. Do not forget that."
<p>MC nodded and I felt myself relax somewhat.
<p>(A smile suits you.)
<p>(Do not suffer while you are with me. I cannot bear to see that happen...)
<p>......
<p>Meanwhile, in a certain merchant house in the port of Sakai...
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Don't mind the intrusion!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Motonari..."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Ain't you running a proper business? Where's my tea? I'm a guest, aren't I?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You've never acted like one. And you don't drink tea."
<p>Kicho shook off Motonari's criticisms much like Motonari shook off Kicho's.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Heh. Got that right! I ain't letting you and skuttle-rats slip me something."
<p>He plopped himself down into a chair, kicking back with a laugh.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "What do you want?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "You know what I want."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "It's time for the next stage of the plan."
<p>Motonari's lips curved in a cruel smile.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "We get the small fry worked up until we wait to get a big fish on the line. One who'll crush Nobunaga for us..."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "But it gets pretty exhausting attacking your ships all to keep up this roundabout show of yers."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "A pirate, tired of pillaging?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "...Tired of being worked over."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "I've been the intermediary for you and yer customers to keep the Oda off yer tail."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "But it won't last for long."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Hell, you gotta know Nobunaga Oda could come crashing down on you, evidence of yer complicity or no."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "My crew pawned a bunch of goods off to Kenshin Uesugi, but he ain't moving."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Don't know why, as everything said he was itchin' for another fight..."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "They wouldn't have become the famous warlords they are if two men operating under fake names could manipulate them."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Any more missteps wlil work against us. 'Bout time I offer my assistance to 'em straight up."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Oh? Are you finally ready to reclaim your clan's name and honor for yourself?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "The Mouri clan can screw themselves... Which is why I don't mind using 'em to help them along the way."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Time for me to get back up on the stage."
<p>Motonari spread his arms wide in a theatrical gesture; Kicho was unmoved by his performance.
<p>His eyes fell to the map on his desk.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "The Oda enclosed by three powerhouses: the Mouri, Takeda, and Uesugi."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Those forced allies who harbored any ill will for Nobunaga will soon see the benefit in joining with his enemies."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Sounds like a party to me!"

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Everyone who thought there'd be peace if only they all sucked up to the Oda were dreaming a stupid dream."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Time for them to wake up and get their heads out of their collective asses."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Whoever thinks they can make the world play nice cause they're standing at the top needs a bullet in their skull."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "So, that is your take on this fight?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Yeah and what about you? You're in this because of some bad breakup and you hate 'im now?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I don't particularly hate Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Nor do I want him to die. Not quickly. This conflict will end if he does."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Complacency is a slow, miserable death. When your life could burn out at any moment, your every action counts."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I want people to start clinging to life. The warring states provides the fuel to make everyone burn brighter."
<p>Kicho watched the flames of the lit candles, intoxicated by their passionate dancing.
<p>His eyes, the cold moon, only seemed to live when they reflected that heat.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "...Yer a madman."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Then I'm in good company."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "That aside, time for me to make a splash with the Uesugi and the Takeda!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "...And, sure, I guess there's no reason to leave that fallen monk outta the party. Speaking of clingin' to life."
<p>Motonari shrugged  his shoulders, laughing.
<p>Just as he stood up to go, one of Kicho's assistants knocked on the door.
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> "Master Kicho."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "What is it?"
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> "A report from one of our Oda spies."
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> "The woman who was talking about 'popcorn' and 'movies'--"
<p><strong>Assistant:</strong> "...She passed out, the cause unknown."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Did she now."
<p>A thin, cruel smile spread across the perfect canvas of Kicho's face.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "What's this about corn and moo... what?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Perhaps I should see her before we enclose the net around Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Who the hell are you talking about?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "A certain woman whose existence will determine wheter I'm correct or not."
<p>......
<p>Two days after MC had passed out from a yet unknown cause...
<p>Though I had been by MC's room twice today, I rushed from another war council to see her.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You appear better today."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Able to move around at least!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What did the doctor say?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Since there's nothing obviously wrong about me, I should be fine unless I start showing symptoms."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...That is too vague. You are not back to full health?"
<p>(Why is her ailment not clearer? This upsets me.)
<p>I found her hands above the futon and gripped them tight.
<p>(...Is it really just exhaustion? Or is it some sickness our doctors cannot understand?)
<p>(If there was a way to be sure, I would spare no expense in finding out the truth.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I've been unable to stop thinking about you lately. I cannot think of anything else."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm sure."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "My mind is a fog. Rational decisions fail me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...It's tough, I know."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You must get better soon."
<p>MC's hands held mine back. She looked at me with adoration.
<p>(I feel all the worse when she does that. Like I am letting her down somehow.)
<p>(It tears at me inside.)
<p>Frustration and irritation beat inside me where she assured me my heart should be. Until a new pulse joined them...
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga, if you've got some time... how about we have a game of Go?"
<p>(A game of Go?)
<p>Her words distracted me.
<p>(Does she want to redo our most recent bet?)
<p>(Is there something she wishes me to say?)
<p>I looked at her, trying to see what that might be, but I sensed no deviousness in her smile.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...If you think your sickness means I will go easy on you, you are wrong."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm ready!"

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p>MC pulled out the Go board with enthusiasm, only to put herself in a losing position almost immediately.
<p>(...What is she doing?)
<p>I did not go easy on her, even then. But it didn't matter, as she led me toward victory.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, look at that! I lost."
<p>(Hmm.)
<p>(My guess was wrong.)
<p>(I thought perhaps she wanted to win and force me to say something to her.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Well, you've got my voice again. What do you want me to say this time?"
<p>(...She wants me to tell her what I want most to hear her say...)
<p>(She remains a most exemplary woman.)
<p>(Here, MC had taken the deal I made with her and crafted a tool to reveal my thoughts.)
<p>Despite her loss, MC looked confident and proud.
<p>It brought warmth to my heart to see her that way. Soon, I found it easy to confess these painful feelings to her.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I feel so helpess when you are sick."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I begin to pray that sickness demons are the true cause of illness, if only so that I can find yours and strike it down."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, Nobunaga..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am a great fool when it comes to you."
<p>(Neither my head nor my heat will obey my commands.)
<p>I cupped her cheek with my palm, seeing her blush slightly beneath me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...This is what I want you to say..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Say that no matter what foolish and dangerous thing I will do to save you--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...you will forgive and allow it."
<p>(Do you see what foolishness you induce [in me] already?)
<p>(Only you are capable of that. And so it shall remain, forever.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I promise... No matter what foolish thing you do to protect me--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I will always... even if it's me alone... I will always forgive you..."
<p>As she spoke, her words became more resolute.
<p>MC placed her hand upon the hand which rested on her cheek, and I found my eyes widening to look at her.
<p>(You must be a fool as well if you are happy to repeat these words.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You speak so boldly about me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...A certain someone asked me to."
<p>Her sweet lips scrunched up in a pouting look when I teased her.
<p>Unable to let them be, I kissed her soothingly.
<p>(No matter how much of a fool I become, I cannot cease loving you. It is impossible.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Masamune and Ieyasu will return to Azuchi in three days."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Really? That's good news."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Upon their return, we will shore up the castle's defenses for our departure to Sakai."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You must get well by then."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Are you taking me with you?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Only if you are in perfect health."
<p>MC squeezed my hand, and I was encouraged by her returning strength.
<p>(You have not lost your sweetness.)
<p>......
<p>Three days later.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Everyone is here?"
<p>My closest warlords were waiting as I entered the audience chamber.
<p>(MC is here too. She looks well.)
<p>Everyone took their seats.
<p>I took my position as well. First, I looked to Masamune and Ieyasu.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I congratulate you on your return."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Can you confirm the report that our enemy are in possession of unusual weaponry?"

<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I congratulate you on your return."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Can you confirm the report that our enemy are in possession of unusual weaponry?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Yes, lord. Cannons larger than we've ever seen, and small guns that fire faster and more accurately than our own."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Not that it helps when the users don't know what they're doing with them."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Their soldiers were obviously in a rush, and untrained in these new weapons."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "A big, expensive waste of nothing."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "However, you could say they proved an annoyance even with that little training."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am heading to Sakai to question Kicho about the mastermind behind the artillery strike on the castle and the insurrections."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Masamune, Mitsuhide, you will come with me. Keiji, you will too, as your familiarity with Sakai will prove valuable."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hideyoshi, Mitsunari, Ieyasu, you three are to stay and bolster our defenses."
<p>Everyone took my orders with a nod of acknowledgement.
<p>I turned to MC.
<p>(Thankfully, she's shown no further trouble these last three days.)
<p>(Still, I should keep her close so that I may keep an eye on her.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, I want you with me, as well."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Happily!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We depart on the morrow. Each of you, see you are prepared."
<p>......
<p>Accompanied by Hideyoshi and Ieyasu, I left to inform the rest of my vassals of my plan.
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "You're really taking someone who passed out three days ago on a big trip?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I know that you're getting at, but until we know what's wrong with MC, it's safer if she's got someone close by."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hideyoshi is correct. However..."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Do you have some other concern, my lord?"
<p>I thought back to after the battle.
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Were you frightened?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No."
<p>......
<p>(She said little else after that.)
<p>(...But she looked at me with sadness.)
<p>(Because I was betrayed?)
<p>(Because I had to kill?)
<p>(...Was it both?)
<p>Moreover, would she look that way when I had to confront Kicho in Sakai?
<p>(Even if I sadden her, I--)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "My lord?"
<p>I was reminded of where I was.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Are you worried about taking MC with you after all?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "No."
<p>I raised my head, leaving those troubling thoughts behind.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There will be no change in my plans."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Go to your chief vassals and see that preparations are made."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi and Ieyasu:</strong> "Yes, my lord."
<p>While Nobunaga sought to shake off his hesitation--
<p>...MC was having a worrisome encounter in the castle-town.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hello?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "If you're in a rush for something, I can wait. What is it you're looking for?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "...Popcorn."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Pretty sure they don't sell that in this--?!"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "I thought it might be you."
