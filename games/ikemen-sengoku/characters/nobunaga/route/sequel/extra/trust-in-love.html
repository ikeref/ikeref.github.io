  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - The Trust in Love Gacha Story</h1>

<h2>Rebelling Against Fate</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga...! The brige! It's--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes, I can see."
<p>Kicho's explosive device had set the bridge aflame. I watched as the fire spread.
<p>(You always were one to prepare...)
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Nobunaga! Are you all right?!"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "...What the...?"
<p>Masamune and Ieyasu had arrived with their troops; they took in the sight.
<p>(The Seta-no-Karahashi bridge will take three days minimum to repair.)
<p>(Kicho would know that. Meaning he is prepared to go to war in those three days.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It was indeed Kicho that MC met."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He was the lone mastermind behind the proliferation of wweapons and the resulting revolts."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Was destroying the bridge his hat trick?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "That was a nice piece of architecture he wrecked."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We know his goals now. We must return to Azuchi and prepare for war."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...War? What, with Sakai? Because wasn't that where we were planning on going?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It was."
<p>I joined them to briefly explain the current situation. They snapped to attention.
<p>(How quickly they respond at the very mention of the word "war".)
<p>I found it useful. But it reminded me of Kicho's words. How much had I made war and violence a part of my daily life?
<p>......
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You are an endless font of hatred and ill will, Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "For all that you attempt to achieve unification through violence, the crimes you carry will beget more violence."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Because you are the spark that keeps the flames of war burning."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "As long as you remain alive, the world you are seeking will never come to pass."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Thus, in punishment for your crimes, you will spend your life doing just that."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You will live and keep this country engulfed in war."
<p>......
<p>(Peace will never come as long as I live?)
<p>(My enemies have spat as much and worse in my face, and it never once bothered me.)
<p>(...Perhaps it was my destiny to die in the fires of Honno-ji that night.)
<p>(But I refuse to believe that MC saving my life could destroy this world and my ambitions.)
<p>After all, she had brought too much positive change into my life for that. I looked at her now.
<p>(...She's frowning?)
<p>My heart was in a vice when MC looked that way.
<p>(Why do you make that expression?)
<p>(Because of what Kicho said? No...)
<p>(...It recalls to mind the way you looked when we dealt with the rebellions.)
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Were you frightened?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No..."
<p>......
<p>(...And that was because... of me.)
<p>That I should cause her such sadness left me feeling short of breath.
<p>(Do not look that way. I do not want you to suffer when I am near.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
<p>She looked up at me in surprise.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If we take what Kicho told us, as long as I can kill him and achieve my goal--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...your future will arrive as it should, and you will continue to live."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Nothing has changed."
<p>That did nothing to clear the concern from her expression.
<p>(...Ah, yes. She reacts better to challenges than to reassurance.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Or do you think I amd the kind of man to lose to Kicho's controlling whims?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "There's no question of that..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...You'll definitely do it."
<p>A bit of light returned to her eyes.
<p>(There.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Good."
<p>I took MC's hand in mine and drew her into my arms.
<p>(MC...)
<p>The tighter I held her, the more the pain in my heart and throat grew; and the more I thought back on Kicho's words.
<p>(It is nonsense to say that my life alone will cause more wars to exist.)
<p>(But--)
<p>......
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Speaking of victims, the woman you love will die, but she was doomed the moment she was born in that future."
<p>......
<p>(If I cannot bring the wars to a close and complete my unification, MC will remain at risk.)
<p>(I cannot yet see how the two are related, but I know they are.)
<p>The writing disappearing from her book, and her unexplained four day coma...
<p>I relied on logic where others trusted in superstition. But too many otherwise unexplainable events had been occurring.
<p>The thorns inside dug deeper.
<p>(I will not let anyone or anything take MC from me.)
<p>(It is unforgiveable that such warmth should leave this realm forever!)
<p>(I swore to protect her from heaven, earth, and the oceans--whatever the cause of her problems.)
<p>(I would tear down anything that threatened her!)
<p>(...But...)
<p>(If... I am what threatens her life...?)
<p>The dark hole my thoughts descended into had no bottom.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...For the moment, you should be your own primary concern..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will not have you disappear on me before I complete my unification..."
<p>I felt as if my very insides were leaving me when I opened my mouth to speak.
<p>(But it should not matter if my continued existence brings threat to your life.)
<p>(...It is this period of war. As long as I can end that while your health remains, that will solve everything.)
<p>I held MC tighter. She looked up at me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...What?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You sound a little... afraid."
<p>(Afraid?)
<p>I had not considered my own emotions until that moment.
<p>(Me... afraid?)
<p>(I do not fear that I might fail to unite these lands!)
<p>(I do not fear that Kicho will stop me...)
<p>(...However... the thought that something might happen to you is...)
<p>The earth below my feet seemed to tilt.
<p>(I have done whatever necessary, taken on any amount of sin to achieve my ambition.)
<p>(Never have I faltered. Never... until the life of this one woman came into question.)
<p>There was nothing puzzling about that.
<p>(It is natural I should feel this way.)
<p>(...Because MC is more important to me than my own life; than the fate of this world.)
<p>(Because I love her.)
<p>I sought to rid myself of the fear she saw; or at least disguise it.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Are you taunting me?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wha? No! No, I wasn't!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "How very bold. And very foolish. You do know what this means, right?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "B-but Nobunaga!"
<p>MC protested, turning around in my arms, her gaze darting around us--
<p>To those inspecting the damage to the bridge, and those readying to convey the message of oncoming war.
<p>...Her protests may have had a point.
<p>(Still, I cannot show fear.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "There's people here... and the bridge is on fire, which is probably more important."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We have too few with us to put it out in time. Thus, I deem us free to do as we like while it burns."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you truly wish me to be less free with your body, you should not give up your games of Go so easily."
<p>Laughing, I stroked the curve of her ear and watched as she blushed under my touch.
<p>MC's lashes fluttered as she cast her gaze down; she was so beautiful.
<p>(...How much time do I have?)
<p>(How much time to save you? ...How much time before you disappear forever...?)
<p>There was no answer.
<p>My question disappeared into the dark pit that had come to reside in my heart.
