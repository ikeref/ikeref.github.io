  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 4 (1-5) - His POV</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "We are certain... she will not wake up?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "That's what our lord said."
<p>I had my inner circle informed of MC's present condition.
<p>They now gathered in my room to discuss.
<p>I did not pay them mind as I should.. I caressed MC's cheek as I would when she would sleep.
<p>(I have called her name. I have shaken her to try and rouse her. That this has some unnatural cause, I have no doubt.)
<p>(But looking at her... it does seem as if she is only sleeping late.)
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Nobunaga, do you want me to call the doctor?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...No..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "No doctor can cure her."
<p>I combed my fingers through her hair. Another familiar action.
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...So, this is definitely a side-effect of what Kicho was talking about?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes."
<p>Her hair lay played across the futon. It was all the same. But nothing was the same.
<p>(Is this... punishment?)
<p>(I've taken life and light from so many. Now I discover warmth, only to have it taken away... Because I do not deserve it.)
<p>(I knew it was unforgiveable, yet I could not keep myself from MC.)
<p>(And now, I'm being punished for that.)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Meaning there's a chance... she might never wake up again...?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Hey! Watch your words! It's not like you to be so pessimistic..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Y-yeah. You're right. Guess it's not... much like me, huh?"
<p>("Not like you.")
<p>Though they were directed elsewhere, those words resonated with [me].
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga, we should call a doctor just in case."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I'll see all your duties are taken care of. Please, spend this time by MC's side."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You will, will you?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Yes, my--?"
<p>(To have Hideyoshi worry over me to this degree... I am certain MC would say it was not like me as well.)
<p>I heard her laugh, but it was only in my mind. I raised my head.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "When exactly did you decide you could order me around?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "M-my lord! I meant nothing of the--!"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "...Shameful, Hideyoshi. Truly shameful. To think, you had aims on your liege's position all this time? I'm in tears."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Time for Hideyoshi to slit his belly open, huh? You need a second for your head?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hold on! We should all thank him before he goes--thanks for the care, buddy."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Yeah, thanks."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Will you all quit it?!"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Please, wait, my lords! I believe Lord Hideyoshi only spoke out of care for Lord Nobunaga, I ask you to reconsider--!"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...It's a joke, Mitsunari."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Of course it is."
<p>I saw my inner circle regain some of that madcap energy they showed in council.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hideyoshi, I grant you command. See that preparations for battle continue."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Yes, my lord! Now, as for the rest of you, get back to work!"
<p>They cast sympathetic looks toward MC before leaving.
<p>......
<p>It had been several hours...
<p>...Or so I supposed. Time seemed to move at a standstill in the quiet.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC."
<p>My voice barely stirred the cold air.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There is no sense in talking to one who cannot hear. To think, I would now be engaging in such foolishness."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC... do you remember what I said?"

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC... do you remember what I said?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...'I will not allow anything to harm you.'"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "'Should heaven and earth and the oceans rise up to swallow you, I shall split them apart to find you.'"
<p>One of MC's hands lay outside the protection of the futon. I placed my own over it. Hers was so small.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not worry."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I shall not forsake my promise."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But I need information first."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I need to learn what brought about your future--the world of 500 years from now."
<p>......
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I'll dedicate my life to keeping this country from achieving unification. Nobunaga's victims will make that easy."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Speaking of victims, the woman you love will die, but she was doomed the moment she was born in that future."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Meanwhile, you will continue to struggle for peace until your dying breath."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "And your battle with me will tear this land asunder, until its future is remade anew--"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Into a better one."
<p>......
<p>(Did Kicho truly arrange this course of events, or was he merely taking advantage of a coincidence?)
<p>(I have no way of knowing. No one in this world--this time, knows the answer.)
<p>(There is a chance I might grasp that knowledge, though. And if there is, I will acquire it.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "For that, I must leave your side for a time."
<p>I laced MC's still fingers in mine.
<p>(I do not fear the wrath of men, gods, or Buddha.)
<p>(But my heart freezes over with ice when I imagine a world without you.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You are not to die before my return."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not even think about it."
<p>(I will not pray to the divine for help.)
<p>(Because I will not hand your fate over to any of them.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...If you do, I will kill you myself."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do you understand?"
<p>I spoke to MC, though I knew she could not hear me.
<p>......
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga?"
<p>Keiji caught me as soon as I left my room.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Keiji. What is it?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I received information from a certain source I thought I'd share with you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Tell me."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Kicho and Motonari Mouri are confirmed to be in league with each other."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "After his so-called death, Motonari aligned himself with a group of pirates."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "He's the one responsible for 'robbing' Kicho's cargo of weapons."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Is that so?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "They're definitely going to put those fast-loading rifles of theirs and that big mortar to use in the next battle."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Now, they were so new, the daimyo who rebelled against you didn't know what they were doing with those guns--"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...But it's a safe bet Motonari's gang has been trained to use them to peak efficiency."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "How very fascinating. Does that last piece of information come from your source or are you simply speculating?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Whoa?!"
<p>He seemed surprised as Mitsuhide crept up close behind him.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Geez, Mitsuhide! Don't scare me like that."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "My lord, as we expected, the Mouri's plan is to enlist as many hostile daimyo as possible to create a net around you."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "[Rumors] say they have even coaxed the Uesugi-Takeda alliance to join them."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Some of our more trustworthy allies are beginning to reconsider their stance."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Given that, and the losses we've taken in the fighting so far, we risk entering this conflict with greatly lowered numbers."
<p>(Fitting for the God of Deceit.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Good work bringing this report."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Now, Keiji--"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Yes?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Your source is not Oda, are they?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Ah..."

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Your source is not Oda, are they?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Ah..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If they were, they would have reported to Mitsunari or Mitsuhide to deliver the information to me."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Guess there's no way of talking myself out of this one, huh?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I made a friend while I was away. We infiltrated Sakai together."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Their name?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Kanetsugu Naoe."
<p>(...Fascinating. And convenient.)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "...My stars! You befriended the Uesugi's chief strategist on a whim?"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Had you not been so forthcoming about it, I'm afraid your head wouldn't be so well attached to your shoulders right now."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I swear on my life, I've got no intention of turning traitor, my lord."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I do not question your loyalty."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And in this particular case, I approve of your being in contact with our enemy. For that connection may prove useful to me."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Your meaning, my lord?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I need you to reach out to your contact; of course, none outside us three are to know."
<p>......
<p>Several days later.
<p>This man was MC's friend. Another from 500 years in the future.
<p>Perhaps I would have found him a more fascinating study were I not in a hurry.
<p>But I cared only about my purpose.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It seems you came alone, as I requested. That takes bravery few possess."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I'm honored, Lord Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Does Kenshin know you are here?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...Yes, he does. Kanetsugu can't--rather, refuses to keep secrets from Lord Kenshin."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am surprised the mad god let you come."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I managed to persuade him--after several active threats on my life."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You did?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I undertsood Nobunaga Oda wasn't likely to call on me privately for any old reason. Besides, this concerns MC... right?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Why do you believe that?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "If my hypothesis is correct, she and I should be in similarly... precarious states."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Is she... Is MC... all right...?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You have been experiencing physical complications as of late?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "That is correct. Migraines and light-headedness."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "And... memory loss."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I... don't even recall what I've forgotten exactly. Just that I've forgotten it..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That would seem to suggest the symptoms differ from person to person."
<p>(But if two people from the future are both experiencing symptoms, that gives credence to Kicho being right.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "A few days ago, MC lost consciousness."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "She has yet to wake up."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...That sounds worse than [what] I have."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I did not come for small talk, Sasuke. You will tell me about your future."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Excuse me?"
<p>(I must learn the truth.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Tell me how I might recreate the future in which MC lived."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What do your history books and guidebooks say happened in this time period?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...You believe changes to the timeline are the cause of these occurrences? I think... I probably would have thought that too."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Let's see. According to my memory of this period... If I have it right, that is--you died."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...I believe it was in the year 1582. They called it... The Honno-ji Incident."
<p>(My death also matches up with what Kicho said. It seems his long absence was spent 500 years in the future.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Was the country unified after my death?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Yes. Your ambitions were succeeded by... Hideyoshi Toyotomi."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "There were various minor conflicts with the remaining powers, and a big--well, the long and short of it is there was peace."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That is not enough. I need to know more. How did Hideyoshi unify the land?"
<p>Sasuke quailed, looking away from me.
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...I'm sorry. There've already been noticeable differences between our two times following my arrival."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I'm afraid that if I tell you any more... history might change further."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "And that might put MC in a worse state than the one she's already in--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am here looking for a way to save her."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I cannot do so unless I know what must change and what must not."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Tell me!"

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am here looking for a way to save her."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I cannot do so unless I know what must change and what must not."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Tell me!"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I'm not normally a betting ninja--"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...So I can only hope that what I'm about to do alters things for the better."
<p>......
<p>I inspected the troops, but my mind was elsewhere. Walking back, I pondered the knowledge I'd burdened myself with.
<p>According to what I'd learned last night, their history had already begun to change, even prior to MC's arrival.
<p>(Which means I cannot be certain what event is linked to MC's state.)
<p>(But if Shingen, Kenshin, and my own deaths being averted are the sole cause, this would have happened sooner.)
<p>(The first time we noticed anything was wrong was... after Kicho destroyed the tenshu--when his plan began.)
<p>(The plan to stop my unification. That is what he is against, and that is what seems to have the biggest impact.)
<p>(Then will this all come to an end if I kill Kicho and complete my work?)
<p>(Or is Kicho right, and my living alone will breed new chaos and new wars?)
<p>(According to MC's future, Hideyoshi unifies the country following my death, to be succeeded by Ieyasu--)
<p>(If my life is the reason this so called "Sengoku period" continues past its rightful end, then there is only one solution.)
<p>(I must die... for MC to live...)
<p>It was no more than a thought experiment, but I felt something as my mind reached that startlingly logical conclusion.
<p>(...To think I would consider suicide.)
<p>I laughed at my conclusion.
<p>(It all seems so ridiculous.)
<p>(That I should gain something so precious as MC's survival by the wasteful act of throwing away my life.)
<p>We had talked about gain, once. She and I.
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What's so funny?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "A woman who cares about me, and doesn't seek to gain from it."
<p>......
<p>(I was so foolish then.)
<p>(But you were right. There was always something to gain.)
<p>(...If it is for the one you love, there is always something to gain.)
<p>This moment, when I stood contemplating eternal separation from MC in exchange for her life--
<p>It was the first time I felt like I had touched the depths of her heart. Something hot built up in my throat and eyes.
<p>I took a deep, shuddering breath and opened the door to my room.
<p>(Even while I consider this, she lays slee-)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...?!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "N-Nobunaga?!"
<p>(...MC!)
<p>I was at her side before I could give voice to her name.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "W-wait! Let me put my clothes back on--"
<p>She moved to cover herself; I took all of her into my arms and kissed her.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobu...naga--Mmmph!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC!"

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobu...naga--Mmmph!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC!"
<p>(When did she wake up?!)
<p>(No, that doesn't matter.)
<p>(She has been asleep for four days. I should be tender with her...)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mm...!"
<p>So much I knew, but my body could not follow the wisdom of my mind.
<p>Instead I kissed MC as if to steal her breath for my own.
<p>(Why?)
<p>(Why do I only hunger for you more, the longer I touch you?)
<p>I felt plagued by this question, even as MC accepted and relished in my unleashed passion.
<p>When I looked down into her dark eyes, my hunger for her roared, even as heat rose up like an inferno inside me.
<p>(I should really let her rest...)
<p>But my body betrayed my mind a second time as I pushed MC down into the futon--not for rest.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Hah..."
<p>(...I...)
<p>I felt a startling lack of control. As if passion for her were all I had left.
<p>I sought MC's tongue to twine with mine when suddenly--
<p>...She carressed the sides of my face with her soft, smaller hands.
<p>(...I feel...)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Ahh, mhmm..."
<p>Slowly, I pulled back. A luxuriant sigh spilled from her red, puffy lips.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "This is... one heck of a wake up... call..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC..."
<p>I took one of her hands in my own.
<p>(...I feel afraid. I do not know what I would do if I had to lose you...)
<p>Clasping that hand, I shut my eyes and swore to guard her life. I sealed that promise with a kiss.
<p>Another kiss. On her wrist. Her upper arm. My lips carried me forward.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mmm..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "These are the only moments I feel like I am myself anymore..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am only free from this ravenous desire when you give yourself over to me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But the moment it is over, I feel that same hunger for you in my very bones. The need to take you and make you mine."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mm, yes..."
<p>(I would lose my mind if I lost you.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you were to disappear, I would turn to ash without you..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Longing for you would burn my soul away."
<p>Her breath hitched in the middle of a kiss, and drawing back, I saw MC looked as if she might cry.
<p>(MC...?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I feel the same, you know."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...My world would lose all meaning if you weren't in it."
<p>(...What?)

<ul>
    <li><strong>"Don't be afraid."</strong></li>
    <li>"Keep me by your side."</li>
    <li>"I can't live without you."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "So don't be afraid that I'll disappear."
<p>(How had I taken so long to realize...?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Nobunaga...?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Is that... so..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What are you thinking?"
<p>(It is true they called me a fool back home.)
<p>(But this is the first time I feel the truth in those words.)
<p>I wanted to laugh at how long it had taken me to realize what was wrong.
<p>(I really am a fool for you.)
<p>(There was always only one choice... and it was not the one I was thinking of.)
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Who's taking watch after you? If you don't have someone, I can take the next shift."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I'm here because if benefits me. But there's no benefit to you in staying here."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "See, 'benefit' means 'something good'. And for me, there's something good about staying here."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And what is that?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Well--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's a secret."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And I'm going to stay."
<p>......
<p>"...I'm going to stay."
<p>To have the one you love beside you is a benefit, in spite of everything else.
<p>(To say you will die for the one you love is only satisfying yourself.)
<p>(The most painful thing is not the death of a loved one...)
<p>(...It is leaving that loved one alone.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga, what is it? Tell me what's--Oh!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is nothing."
<p>MC arched beautifully as I sought her innermost heat. Her loving cries were music to my ears.
<p>How could I have ever considered leaving her alone in this world? I cannot.
<p>(You have saved me from almost making a horrible mistake.)
<p>(Now, I know what I must do.)
<p>I held onto the fire in my chest so that I might use it in the coming battle.
<p>(I will continue to protect you at any cost... and I will succeed.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not ask me anything. Just... let us feel each other in this moment."
