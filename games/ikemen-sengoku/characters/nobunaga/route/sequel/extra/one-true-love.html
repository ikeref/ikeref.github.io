  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - One True Love Gacha Story</h1>

<h2>Happiness to the Kind Demon</h2>
<p>It had rained for several days; then, one day, when the sky was finally clear--
<p>(...As always, there is no controlling them.)
<p>My inner circle, that is.
<p>The pandemonium that had been our councils in Azuchi looked to continue in Osaka castle.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "All right, cool it! You're in front of Lord Nobunaga, remember! ...Hrgh. Why is it always like this?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Aww, I like it when everyone's having fun!"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Oh? Challenging both Hideyoshi and our lord. How bold our little seamstress has become."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's bold? No way! I've seen how you guys act! Trust me, no one holds back an opinion in this castle."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Right, Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hmm."
<p>MC was laughing and smiling as she talked and joked with them.
<p>I, meanwhile, felt a strange, warm tickle in my chest. Not painful. Just an annoyance.
<p>(...There it is again.)
<p>(It's that tightness in my throat.)
<p>(Am I coming down with something? It does not feel like a cold or cough...)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga? Are you okay?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Yes."
<p>(And now it has gone away.)
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Why is your castle always so noisy?"
<p>A most spiteful voice heralded the entrance of another noisy group.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You've arrived."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Yes. To talk to you. Not your... circus."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "I'd describe it more like a dump. Except for the lone, beautiful flower that makes it all worthwhile. Hello again, MC."
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "My lord, do you want Nobunaga to fight you? Actually, I know the answer to that."
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "Is Shingen being quarrelsome? I thought he was just flirting with MC."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "That would be where the problem lies."
<p>After that, the noise lessened for the moment.
<p>Though rising tension took its place.
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Small room to hold as many big shots as we've got in here."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "The Date clan head can speak when my lord has business with your territory."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I'd say being allies with your ally, meaning you, by extension, gives me plenty of reason to talk--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Enough."
<p>Silence fell over the tenshu once more, though the glares remained.
<p>(The wars have ended, but the aggression and bitterness remain.)
<p>(How much longer until they realize this petty infighting will only damage the value of our alliance?)
<p>Some positive results, perhaps, would convince them that this new union was the right way to do things.
<p>(Something that will satisfy them both...)
<p>I was about to order my own warlords out for the moment when MC leaned over toward me.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What is it?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I have a pretty good idea at how to make everyone get along? Are you cool if I try it?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You have an idea?"
<p>She only smiled slyly in response.
<p>(No one surprises me better than she.)
<p>(...And no one else gets to the heart of a matter as fast as MC either.)
<p>(Very well. I shall have faith in her idea.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You may go ahead."
<p>...What she suggested to everyone was---
<p>......
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Alley-oop!"
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Not bad, Keiji! Not as good as mine!"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Is it fair that all the stupidly tall and athletic guys were put on the same team?"
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "I believe that's what they call the luck of the draw--though it is unluck, for others."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Yo, Kanetsugu! You maybe wanna help your teammates on the red team a little?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Lord Kenshin is on the white team. Why would I help the red team?"
<p>I watched as the Oda warlords, along with the Uesugi and Takeda, tossed some small bags into one of two baskets.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What is this game?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, just your classic bean bag toss! I had to use a different filler in place of the beans though!"
<p>(I've heard of neither "bean bags" nor a game where you toss them.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And this will put them at peace?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Not by the end of round one, no."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But if they keep playing these fun games with each other? Yeah, I think they'll come to like each other."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Is this fun? It appears to be a competition."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I cannot see how competing breeds positive emotions toward one another."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Yeah? Talk to me again at the end of the game!"
<p>MC grinned; I decided to do as she said and hold my questions.
<p>(There is something positive gained when you win a war or revitalize a town. Even hawking has proven "fun".)
<p>(That is because by the end of it, you have accomplished a goal.)
<p>(But they are even fishing the bags out of the baskets at regular intervals. This game has vague goals and little point.)
<p>Regardless, I watched intently, hoping to understand MC's meaning.
<p>Just then--
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "I will finish this!"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...Lord Kenshin, are you about to invent the mythical triple fast ball?!"
<p>Kenshin had several of the small bags in one hand and pitched them at the basket.
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "Watch it! You'll knock it over!"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...MC, it's headed your way!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What is--?!"
<p>The bags impacted with the basket and knocked it off the high holding platform, sending it flying toward MC.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ack!"
<p>(You are a danger to yourself sometimes.)
<p>I grabbed her in my arms and took the blow from the rogue basket to my back.
<p>...It did not hurt. However--
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Whoa, whoaaa?!"
<p>MC, surprised by the whole affair, tumbled backward.
<p>...While gripping me tightly.
<p>That, I was not ready for.
<p>(A danger to both of us--!)
<p>Somehow, I thrust my hands out toward the ground so as to not fall on her.
<p>But the two of us did fall.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Oof..."
<p>I looked at MC below me--
<p>...Through the wicker basket which had somehow landed atop my head.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "..."
<p>I heard two brief gasps, from Hideyoshi and Mitsuhide, if I had to assume.
<p>After that, silence.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Look what your lord did to my lord!"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "The fault lies in the shoddy preparation given to this game--which was your side's suggestion, I hasten to point out."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I do believe the cause can be traced directly to Kenshin's 'mythical triple fast ball', as Master Sasuke described."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sorry! Sorry! This really is all my fault! Are you okay, Nobunaga?"
<p>(Am I... "okay"...?)
<p>I looked around at all the others, still making noise.
<p>I looked down at MC, blushing sheepishly below me.
<p>I looked at the dozens of "bean bags" that had fallen around me. One slipped off my head, dropping the basket lower.
<p>(What is going on...?)
<p>I felt that strange tickle in my chest again. It built.
<p>As it climbed up my throat, I felt as if I had a sudden need to cough.
<p>(Is this...?)
<p>And so I did cough.
<p>Except that it was not a cough that left my lips, but a sudden puff of air--
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hmph... Hmph... Ha...!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Nobunaga? Did you hit your head? Can you speak?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Ha ha... Ha ha ha ha ha! Hahaha!"
<p>(There IS no point to this game of hers! It is sheer chaos!)
<p>(My ambition was to quell the chaos in this land. If so, why am I laughing now?)
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Lord... Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "Oh yeah. He DEFINITELY hit his head."
<p>I was laughing. When was it that I last laughed this hard? This naturally?
<p>When the impulse left me at last, I looked back down at MC.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Haha haaa... Ah. MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Y-yes?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I finally understand."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh!"
<p>(I understand what makes this fun.)
<p>(I understand why experiences like these... why positive experiences build kinship among even former rivals.)
<p>MC's eyes lit up.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm so glad!"
<p>She smiled like a flower in bloom, and I smiled back at her to see it.
<p>At last, I took the basket off my head and stood up.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Now then, everyone here will pay for the crime of hitting me with this basket."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Err! Nobunaga?!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Kenshin Uesugi. It was your strike that knocked it over."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "That's right."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are on the white team, so I will join the red team. And I will score double the amount your entire team has!"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "...Just the fight I've been waiting for!"
<p>I would show them what serious competition was like!
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Haha!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are still laughing."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Because you got so into the game after that! Watching you was funny!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's been a busy few months, so having that time to relax and goof off felt really great."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes, it did."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Today was... fun."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh yeah?"
<p>Her eyes lit up once more; MC leaned in to kiss me.
<p>(This is my reward for having fun, is it?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Mnm! I'm glad..."
<p>I flicked her tongue with mine, noting how her cheeks took on heat when I pulled away. And I laughed again.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Heh."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And why are you laughing?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Because I love you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And I love the time we spend together. I love it so much I fear as if I have no choice but to laugh."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I see you are laughing too now."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Ahaha!"
<p>I did not need to hear her response to know we were laughing for the same reason.
<p>It is true there is something positive gained when you achieve a goal.
<p>And there is something positive to be gained in doing nothing at all.
<p>(You have changed my entire worldview.)
<p>(And you do it as if it were nothing at all.)
<p>MC revitalized the world around me, showed me something new and wonderful every time I opened my eyes.
<p>When I balked at the brightness of the sights she showed me, she would just smile and gently show me them again.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I love you, Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I, too, love you."
<p>Someday, we would reminisce on this day.
<p>And when that time came, we would say to each other, "We had fun."
<p>The image of that day I painted in my mind was another dazzling and warm sight that caused me to laugh once more...
