  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Passionate - Chapter 7 (6-10)</h1>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p>We left Mitsunari outside to command the blockade while the rest of us went inside.
<p>Keiji took the lead. I stuck close by Hideyoshi as we crept into the deadly silent manor.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...What the hell?"
<p>There were no lanterns lit in any of the rooms. No signs of life or movement.
<p>However, there was a line of candles, set in fixed intervals at either wall leading down a certain hallway.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Um... anyone else super creeped out?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Guy knows how to decorate for a party."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Nice of him to show us where he is."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Or maybe he's got something in there that'll win the game for him? Whether he does or not, I don't like his style..."
<p>Cautiously, we followed the candle-lit path. It stopped in front of a certain door.
<p>(Inside...)
<p>(...Kicho's inside...)
<p>I felt something pounding inside me. Not my heart. A pounding in my veins. In my blood.
<p>I found it hard to [breathe].
<p>(Do I... want to see him?)
<p>(...No. I don't want to "see" him at all.)
<p>(What... do I want to... do to him?)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Let's go."
<p>Hideyoshi's sharp call dispersed that worrisome question.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "All right, Kicho! Don't move!"
<p>He threw open the door. Everyone spilled inside after him.
<p>On a couch of deep emerald green, I began to make out his relaxed--No, I turned away before I reached his face.
<p>(I knew it. I knew I didn't want to see him...)
<p>(...Because... because when I look at him, I want... I want to...!)
<p><strong>Kicho's Voice:</strong> "Why shout? I can hear you."
<p>That cool voice of his. Free of the burden of those "silly emotions" the rest of us had.
<p>I heard that callous, unconcerned voice and something in me snapped.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You're late."
<p>Kicho was dressed in white, but all I saw when I looked at him was red.
<p>(You killed--)
<p>His alabaster fingers toyed with his pistol.
<p>(You killed my--!!)
<p>I was shaking. Or the world was.
<p>I bit down on my lip and screamed silently. Or maybe I screamed aloud. Screaming into the cavity where my heart had been.
<p>(And I... I ha--...!)
<p>......
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "There are many who hate Lord Nobunaga because they have heard of his villainous deeds. Others have a more personal reason."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Some lost their station, some their families, some those they love..."
<p>......
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...What do you know...?"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You cannot possibly have experienced the kind of hatred that burns your soul every waking moment of your life."
<p>......
<p>(...I hate you. I HATE YOU!)
<p>(You took away the one I love!)
<p>The man who was more important to me than my own life.
<p>......
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Hatred is nothing more than the reverse of love. The greater the one grows, the greater its twin becomes."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "The cruelest acts, those defying both morals and logic, are always motivated by a form of strong love."
<p>......
<p>(Mitsuhide was right...)
<p>I'd been digging my nails into my hands so hard I'd accidentally drawn blood.
<p>(Kicho took Nobunaa away from me, and I hate him more than I can stand!)
<p>(I will never, never let him--!)
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...I was told Nobunaga died. Is it true?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Like you don't know when you're the one who murdered him!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "That's a shame. I instructed my man to hit someplace that wasn't fatal."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Wasn't fatal?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Of course. If I merely injured him, I could continue chipping away at his hegemony."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "My goal was to harm his authority bit by bit... Play with him for a time. I'm disappointed."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...The feeling's mutual! The only upshot to this is your plan failing."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Not that it matters, really."
<p>Kicho reacted to the news of Nobunaga's death with neither sadness nor joy.
<p>(You're "disappointed"? It "doesn't matter"?)

<ul>
    <li>There were no words.</li>
    <li>"You're heartless."</li>
    <li><strong>"...That's all!?"</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Is that all you have to say about the life of the man you murdered?"
<p>Kicho's gaze fell on me now.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Life is precious. Unbearably so. But when it ends, it's over. That's it."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "How dare you--!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...And I see that you're still alive. Which means I haven't done enough."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What do you mean by that?!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "It means if someone here were to kill me, they would proceed to carry on Nobunaga's legacy and unite Japan in his place."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You got that right!"
<p>With all the leisure in the world, Kicho stood up from his sofa, his white coat flowing elegantly behind him.
<p>I hated how graceful he was, this man who'd brought nothing but pain to me.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "That's exactly why I was waiting for you."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Waiting for... what?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "For what follows the 'tragic news' of Nobunaga Oda's death..."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "His forces scramble after losing their leader, failing to capture a lone merchant in their foolhardy quest for revenge."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "My task tonight? To elude you."

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Now goodbye."
<p>A set of gorgeous screen doors were thrust open in [the] heretofore quiet manor.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...You won't escape!"
<p>But Kicho wove swiftly through the oncoming rush of hidden mercenaries who spilled into the room.
<p>We weren't alone in the manor anymore!
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "As if this room isn't hard enough to get around in with all this junk!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Keiji! We'll go out back and catch him that way! Ieyasu! Masamune! You two take care of these guys!"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Got it!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "MC, c'mon!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "O-okay!"
<p>......
<p>From creepy silence to almost disturbing amounts of shouting and violence, the manor was a different place now.
<p>(And was that a gunshot I heard?! Where'd it come from? Outside?)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Must've had guys waiting outside too. MC, don't leave our side!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'll stay as close as I can."
<p>(Unless I spot Kicho.)
<p>(...No promises what I'll do then.)
<p>But they didn't have to know that.
<p>I followed them out of the manor.
<p>As expected, more of Kicho's hired guns were engaged in battle with our troops.
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 1:</strong> "This is for Lord Nobunaga!"
<p><strong>Mercenaries:</strong> "Gha!"
<p>(I've never seen anything like this.)
<p>Nobunaga had taken me to several battles, but the battle to avenge him was more heated and brutal than any I'd seen.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Where's... Kicho?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Considering how hard he's trying to keep us pinned here, probably as far away from the manor as he can get."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Lord Hideyoshi!"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "A message from the soldiers surrounding the manor. A man they suspect was Kicho broke through and was running to the port."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "The port, huh? We'll catch him before he leaves! Mitsunari? You're in charge here!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Remember, they're mercenaries! There's no need to finish them off. They'll stop fighting when it stops being worth it!"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Understood, my lord."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Let's go!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Right!"
<p>(The port... Kicho thinks he's going to try and flee by boat, does he?)
<p>(I won't let him...!)
<p>(I won't let him trick more people into fighting while he watches from up on high.)
<p>(Even if I have to--)
<p>I ran after Hideyoshi.
<p>Keiji trailed after us.
<p>......
<p>The sea was like a creature made of midnight; its fur undulating in waves; its growl a crashing, watery roar.
<p>But the sea's cries weren't the only sound. The clang of steel and the discharge of guns resounded throughout the port.
<p>(It's so hard to see in this--There he is!)
<p>I began running toward Kicho.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...MC, wait!"
<p>Keiji grabbed my arm, pulled me back.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Stay back!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But he's right there--!"
<p>I heard the sickening sound of flesh being rent from beside me and looked.
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Ugh!"
<p>Kicho cut down one of our guards with zero hesitation.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Move."
<p>The dead man looked at me from the ground where he fell with wide, glassy eyes.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hideyoshi and some of the guys are sneaking around behind him right now."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "They are?"
<p>(When did they break away? I don't see--)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "If you leap out now, you know he's gonna drop everything to protect you."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Now's not the time."
<p>Keiji's words brought me back.
<p>(I haven't been paying enough attention.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sorry. You're right."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Don't apologize. You didn't do nuthin' wrong."
<p>With Keiji guarding me, I stayed back in the shadows and just kept my eye on Kicho.
<p>(It's okay. I don't need to do anything.)
<p>(Hideyoshi will get revenge for Nobunaga...)
<p>Then... maybe then, this roiling mass of hatred inside me will go away.
<p>...Maybe then I'll be able to accept a world without Nobunaga in it.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Your comeuppance has come, Kicho."
<p>I watched as Kicho turned in surprise--
<p>Hideyoshi lifted his blade high--
<p>FWEE!
<p>Suddenly, a sharp whistle.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "What's that?!"
<p>(That gleam--rifles!)
<p>From one of the large ships docked at port, a dozen men with rifles rose up, their guns pointed at Hideyoshi and the others.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "It feels so DAMN GOOD when you've got the other side out-gunned!"

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p><strong>???:</strong> "It feels so DAMN GOOD when you've got the other side out-gunned!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Motonari... Mouri?!"
<p>(Motonari?!)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I thought he skipped out on that last battle awfully fast!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "So this is where he was hiding!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You're late."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Either I come on time or I come with guns. Which one would you prefer?"
<p>With over a dozen guns pointed at him and his men, Hideyoshi and the other Oda had no choice but to back away from Kicho.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...I heard you and your vassals fled to your castle for safety?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "What are you doing here?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Stoppin' you from getting revenge for Nobunaga and wrappin' these islands up in a warm, safe blanket, that's what!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "What?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "And before ya go thinkin' you defeated me in that last battle, I only left cause it was never about winning!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "It was about knockin' Nobunaga down a peg just when he thought he'd made his big ol' triumphant return."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "So, you can bet yer damn boots we're not gonna let you do the same!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Now then! Anyone who doesn't want a new hole in 'em better back the hell away!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Grr..."
<p>Hideyoshi and the others backed away as Motonari directed.
<p>Behind a laughing Motonari, several burly seamen let down a gangway for Kicho.
<p>(He's going to escape--)
<p>Kicho smiled. He smiled and began walking.
<p>(He's really planning on running!)
<p>And here I was, protected by Keiji, only able to watch as he escaped.
<p>(No! I don't want him to get away!)
<p>(But what can I do about it?)
<p>Time seemed to slow.
<p>In my mind I pictured...
<p>...Nobunaga.
<p>(What would you do in a time like this?)
<p>(You wouldn't put your men directly in the line of fire, I know that.)
<p>("There is no value in such pointless death," you'd say. Because you really did care about people.)
<p>(You'd tell them to wait for the right moment. Then you'd turn to me and tell me not to leave your side...)
<p>Because Nobunaga would already be one step ahead. He'd have a plan to capture Kicho and Motonari in one fell swoop.
<p>(I knew I could rely on you. You always protected me.)
<p>(I couldn't protect you though.)
<p>(But I can protect your ideals!)
<p>(And you'd better believe I can take on the men who stopped you before you could achieve them and I can--!)
<p>My mind ground to a halt.
<p>(What do I want to "do" to Kicho?)
<p>(Of course I want to prevent him from ruining your unification, to see it completed in your name. But--)
<p>(How do I stop him?)
<p>(Do I... kill him?)

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p>(Of course I want to prevent him from ruining your unification, to see it completed in your name. But--)
<p>(How do I stop him?)
<p>(Do I... kill him?)
<p>Was that what I wanted? To kill Kicho?
<p>(If I kill him, I can ensure Nobunaga's ideals lives on. But what if I'm wrong and I'd only be killing him to bring myself peace?)
<p>I felt like I'd been put in this situation before.
<p>(...I've been confronted with the choice to kill someone before--Ah!)
<p>.......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "This is a matchlock pistol. I acquired it from the Westerners."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "A shot from this will pierce through flesh and even shatter bone."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Draw the blade and klil me. Do it, before I kill you."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I refuse."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then you're prepared to die?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Absolutely not."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What?"
<p>(Both options are awful. So I choose to take a third.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm prepared to talk though."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Of all the things you thought might save your life, that's what came to mind?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Your life hangs in the balance and you risked [it] all to have a conversation with me?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Your naivete knows no bounds."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But you bravely stood up for your ideals."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ideals are worth standing up for."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Agreed."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I can't udnerstand the world that gave rise to your optimistic beliefs, and I don't acknowledge them--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But I enjoy spending time with you and hearing you speak of them."
<p>......
<p>Nobunaga's face was so clear in my mind. And with that clarity, that memory, the red fog lingering over me dispersed.
<p>(Right. That was my decision...)
<p>I felt the roiling anger that had driven me here slowly melt off me.
<p>(Killing. Dying. Either is a tragedy. And death for death doesn't make things better--)
<p>(...Even if it's the person you hate the most.)
<p>(The person I loved the most loved me in spite of my naive, optimistic views.)
<p>Kicho climbed the gangway onto the boat.
<p>I dashed out from behind Keiji and ran up after him.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "MC?!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "What're you--?! You idiot!"

<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "MC?!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "What're you--?! You idiot!"
<p>(...Whoa! Holy Cats! I was NOT prepared for the ship to be shaking this much!)
<p>I fell to my knees as soon as I hit the deck. I stood up, only to receive the nice welcome of a gun barrel pointed at my face.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Um! Hello..."
<p>I looked back at the man aiming at me.
<p>He whistled a mocking note.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "What's this, m'lady? Tired of the Oda now that Nobunaga's gone? Come to join the side where all the fun stuff happens?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No, and no! Also, I've signed an exclusivity agreement with the Oda. A permanent one!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Huh. Never heard that one before..."
<p>I guess Motonari traded in curiosities, because that got him to lower his gun.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Why are you here? You shouldn't waste your life this way."
<p>I glared at Kicho, who only sighed with exasperation.
<p>("Waste"? You had Nobunaga shot, got everyone involved in a war, and you tell ME not to waste my life?)
<p>(That's... crazy.)
<p>(But Kicho seems like he's being honest. Why then? It's not pity. What is it?)
<p>......
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "If it helps, it's not personal. Your life is a necessary sacrifice."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I hope this knowledge can help you treasure what time you have left."
<p>......
<p>(The first day we met too.)
<p>(He considered my death a "sacrifice" and told me to treasure the time I had left.)
<p>He clearly understood the value of life.
<p>Yet he engaged in a battle that cost so many lives. In a way, he was like Nobunaga.
<p>(He must have something... some plan, and like Nobunaga, he'd broken a vital part of himself to see it through.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm not wasting my life."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You see, every part of me, my hands, my ears, my feet, my lap, my lips, my heart--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It all belongs to Nobunaga, and I would never let something of his go to waste."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Did you come here for a boring emotional appeal or did you have a purpose?"
<p>(I won't ever forgive what you did.)
<p>(I hate you more than I can stand.)
<p>(But that doesn't change who I am!)
<p>(And THIS is how I resolve things!!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I want to talk."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Let's talk about this!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...What?"
<p>Just then--
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Eek?!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Hmm?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "The hell?!"
<p>There was a thunderous sound; a cacophony of water, wood, and metal.
<p>(What was THAT? A cannon?! Some kind of deep sea earthqua--AH?!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Oof! Oww..."
<p>I slammed into the deck. Again.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "What's going on?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Who DARES ram me?!"
<p>(Whoa! Big ship!)
<p>I stared where Kicho and Motonari stared.
<p>Another shpi, at least as large as the one we were on, had rammed their prow into the side of ours.
<p>The sound I'd heard was that of our ship splintering apart. Wood bending and breaking; the ship was still screeching.
<p>A rush of sea water and foam had washed onto the ship with the crash.
<p>(But I would have thought all these ships are under either Motonari or Kicho's control. Who did this?)
<p>I threw my arms around the mast for balance when I heard a voice--
<p>...A voice so familiar I thought my heart would break if I dared put a name to it.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Hideyoshi, you idiotic monkey! What are you waiting for? Now is the right moment!"
