  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Passionate - Chapter 8 (6-10)</h1>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "It's true then...!"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 2:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga is back!"
<p>It was the morning after we captured Kicho's merchant house. Sakai was no longer quiet but filled with cheers.
<p>(Everyone's so surprised! Of course!)
<p>(I mean, getting Hideyoshi to lie about Nobunaga's death? That was smart. Anyone would have believed Hideyoshi!)
<p>The gathered soldiers kept a reverent distance, looking up at him with respect, admiration, and most noticeably, awe.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "...As if he's some sort of god."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Isn't that normal for our guys?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I apologize for calling you here so early in the morning."
<p>Hideyoshi spoke to all the soldiers.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Though it was key to our strategy, I'm sorry for betraying your trust."
<p>His voice grew loud with his apology; then he thrust his head down in a deep bow.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Aww! Hideyoshi--!"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Lord Hideyoshi..."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Hmph."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 1:</strong> "Lord Hideyoshi! Please, you mustn't!"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 2:</strong> "Raise your head, we beg you!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "No, I owe you at least this much!"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 3:</strong> "You don't owe us anything!"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 4:</strong> "Not a one of us feels betrayed! Isn't that right?"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 5:</strong> "Of course it is! Lord Nobunaga trusted you alone among all of us with this task."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 5:</strong> "And of course he would! We respect that. And you."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...You do...?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I agree with them, Lord Hideyoshi."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Right? You were probably suffering the most, having to lie like that."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Thank you. Thank you all."
<p>Hideyoshi bowed low once more. But there were more smiles when he raised his head.
<p>(You're an amazing guy, Hideyoshi. No wonder Nobunaga trusts you so.)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "What a moving sight. I feel as if I might be driven to tears."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Could you NOT ruin things?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Are you finished?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Yes, lord."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are too conscientious. You could have simply told them it was my orders."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I'm afraid I couldn't."
<p>Hideyoshi bowed to Nobunaga this time; Nobunaga smiled at him.
<p>Now it was his turn to address the men.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is time to advance to the next stage in our military conquest."
<p>Everyone listened intently.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We must take the Mouri's citadel, Yoshida-Koriyama Castle."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Once it is under our control, the western region is as good as ours."
<p>(No rest for the weary. Or the recently dead, in Nobunaga's case.)
<p>(But we'll be all right.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
<p>Nobunaga drew me into his arms.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You will ride with me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Death failed to claim me. Nothing can stand in the way of my unification now."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I want you to see that for yourself, at my side."

<ul>
    <li><strong>"I'll be right there."</strong></li>
    <li>"Don't worry."</li>
    <li>"I can do more."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'll be right there, watching."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Good."
<p>There was nothing to be afraid of.
<p>(Nobunaga's love saved me in my darkest moments.)
<p>(If anything threatens him the same way, he'll have my love to save him.)
<p>(...And I'm confident of that.)
<p>This was the battle to put an end to the Sengoku. To all the anger and the loss.
<p>We would win it. Of that, I was certain.
<p>......
<p>Several months later...
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hello there!"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "You..."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Hello yourself, sweet princess of the Oda. Why, it seems you've only grown more lovely since last we met."

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "STOP flirting with women! Can't you just talk to them like normal!?!"
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Yuki, I am talking to her. What you hear as flirting is my saing what too many are too cowardly to say: the truth."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Nice to see you again, MC. Have there been any changes of note?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "As you can see, we've got the tenshu repaired. And Nobunaga's all healed up."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "That's excellent news."
<p>After the incident with Kicho, rumors that Nobunaga had come back to life to stop his would-be assassins spread like wildfire.
<p>Said rumors declared he was more powerful than ever. The Oda did more than regain their hegemony--
<p>Nobunaga was at near deity status now!
<p>(Amazing to think this was not only his plan all along, but that it worked so well!)
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "So, you're all relocating to Osaka now?"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "For trade, was it?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yep. But my goodness, moving a whole castle is difficult! This has got to be my biggest challenge as chatelaine yet!"
<p>As it happened, the Uesugi and Takeda took the opportunity to ally with the Oda; we were even on a conversation level.
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "If only you were staying."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Well, Osaka Castle needs a chatelaine too."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "At least I got a certain someone to come with us in time to say hello, before we all have to say goodbye that is."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh? You brought a friend?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "I cannot imagine there is much benefit to be gained from making my acquaintance."
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "Though I see no reason not to exchange greetings, at least. Hello, MC. My name is Yoshimoto Imagawa."
<p>I would have accepted "prettiest guy you'll ever meet" as his name too. I mean, Mitsunari was pretty, but DAMN.
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "Head of the same Imagawa that ruined Ieyasu's childhood and attempted to destroy Nobunaga only to fail magnificently."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Uh... O-okay...?"
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "Wow. Great introduction, Yoshimoto..."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "My cousin here, is not as bad as he seems. In fact, he's a real prince! Well, closer to being a prince than any of us."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Uh... O-okay? Also, hellow. I hope we get... along?"
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "I'd like that very much."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Why?"
<p>Kenshin spat out the word, obsessively nudging his katana out of his sheath only to return it with a clack.
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "...Why must we get along? We USED to have battles! Where did all those go...?"
<p>(I see Kenshin's healthy coping mechanisms are as delightful to watch as ever...)
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Lord Kenshin."
<p>I turned, hearing a new voice. Quiet, yet stern. Like metallic thread.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "We are ready to depart."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Kanetsugu, I'm bored."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Have you tried fighting Sasuke, my lord?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...You discover wormholes, you master the ninja arts in less than four years, and somehow, you still end up as a chew toy."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Psst. Who's that guy who just threw you under the bus, Sasuke?"
<p>I looked back at him to see him bow reverently to Kenshin.
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Oh, my apologies. You haven't been introduced yet, have you?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "That's Kanetsugu Naoe. He manages Echigo's internal affairs. A stabilizing force on Lord Kenshin and his right-hand man."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Cool. Good explanation. Are we sure about the stabilizing part though?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "What are you two whispering about?"
<p>A pair of relentless eyes fixed on me.
<p>(Yeah, no. I don't see stabilizing. I see a mini-Kenshin, only he keeps his blades tucked away in those eyes of his.)
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "You're Nobunaga Oda's lover?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes, I'm MC. It's a pleasure to meet you."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "You should convey it to him that if Echigo is denied its self-governance, Lord Kenshin will come to take your lord's head."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "See that he understands the seriousness of the situation."
<p>(Yet another pretty boy who needs a life coach. It's been a while since I've been introduced to them rapid-fire like this...)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'll see he gets the message."
<p>He seemed all business, so I tried being as respectful as possible. He quickly lost interest in me and went back to Kenshin.
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Kanetsugu isn't one for small talk, but he's actually very entertaining."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Why, does he juggle?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "You'll find out for yourself in time."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "By the way, how's the former Mouri territory faring?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Pretty good. I heard it's under Hideyoshi and Mitsunari's care now."
<p>Motonari Mouri had gone underground. The rest of his clan submitted to Nobunaga.
<p>Those who'd betrayed him or stubbornly held out also returned to Oda rule. Japan was now a unified country.
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Good, good. Speaking of contacts..."

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "...I've received news from Kennyo."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Really?! What did he say?"
<p>Once Nobunaga returned to Azuchi, he had Kennyo released.
<p>The two of them had a long talk in private before Kennyo and his followers departed.
<p>(I don't know what it was they discussed, but it seems to have worked out...)
<p>I recalled the look on Kennyo's face as he left. It seemed to me, at least, he was ready to put his vengeance aside.
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "He said that he, Ranmaru, and the others have started to rebuild Hongan-ji."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's wonderful news!"
<p>(I bet Ranmaru's happy, finally.)
<p>I was so glad for them all.
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "I have heard you've had no luck finding Kicho and Motonari?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's right."
<p>Despite all the resources we put into finding them, we'd failed to catch them or even discover their current whereabouts.
<p>The ghosts of the Sengoku period had returned to the shadows, to await the coming of night once again...
<p>(...Or maybe they'll see the good progress we've made and change their minds too? Hey, a girl can hope.)
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "MC, do you mind if I ask how you've been feeling recently?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "The 'timeline sickness' you mean? Lately, there's been no dizziness, no weird buzzing sounds, no passing out. You?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "My symptoms have similarly faded."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I haven't pored over my traveler's guide for reasons, but I glanced at it and didn't see any blank pages."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm pretty sure we've changed history quite a bit from what we know, but--"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...But the sailent points are such that they lead to a timeline in which our existence is theoretically still possible?"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Sasuke, are you talking magic again?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "No, Lord Kenshin--it's science."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Whatever it is, I don't like it. I don't like how peaceful it's gotten. I'm not suited for peace. And neither is Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "...Or so I thought."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's right, he's different now!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Finally, everyone can see the goodness inside him."
<p>(I've never met anyone who feels responsible for as many people as Nobunaga.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga's Voice:</strong> "MC!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oops! Speaking of--!"
<p>Turning around, I spotted him down the hallway.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "How long do you intend to keep me waiting? Come along."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "On my way!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay, everyone! I'll see you around!"
<p>I bowed to them and ran to see Nobunaga.
<p>Slowly but surely, we were building a country that was not only more peaceful, but more connected as well.
<p>......
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "...Yeah, Nobunaga's changed. But MC's changed too."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Yes, she has."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "She's a good equal to Nobunaga Oda."
<p>Sometime after that...
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay, wow!"
<p>After several days of travel, I looked upon our new home, Osaka Castle.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I thought Azuchi was impressive. It is, but this blows it out of the water!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "When Lord Nobunaga entrusted me with its design, I spared no expense in making a fitting domicile for my lord!"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Ah. A massive, towering representation of your love for Lord Nobunaga. That would certainly explain things..."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Explain what?"
<p><strong>Masamune and Ieyasu:</strong> "How showy it is."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I find it dazzling in its extravagance."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "The whole castle just screams 'loyalty'! I'm surprised you didn't hang up a big banner! ...Or is it on the way?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Y-you guys really think that?! ...M-my lord... is it... is it too much...?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I approve of it. I commend you, Hideyoshi."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Thank you for your words, my lord!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hee hee!"
<p>It was always so fun being with everyone.
<p>(Ahaha! Ahh, I've been smiling to much lately my cheeks are hurting!)
<p>Keiji broke away from teasing Hideyoshi to talk to me.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You doing all right? Healthwise?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yep. Thanks for being so concerned."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I've got a reputation as an eccentric, but Lord Nobunaga's outdone me."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Making your own woman think you're dead just to trick your enemies? That's one for the records..."
<p>Keiji shrugged his shoulders and laughed.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'll never let him forget it, either! I think I can probably ride the guilt from this one out for several decades, at least!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You do that."
<p>(I wouldn't have made it through those times without Keiji and the others.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hey, Keiji?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Yeah?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thanks for being there for me."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Uh."

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You know what? It was nothing! If you need a shoulder to lean on, Keiji Maeda here's got two of 'em ready for you!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I appreciate it. Oh, they're crossing the bridge! Come on, let's catch up with them!"
<p>I ran after Nobunaga and the others.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Yeah."
<p>More dazzling than the lavish castle, perhaps, was the look in Keiji's eyes as he watched MC run.
<p>...The celebratory party began early that afternoon and lasted long into the night.
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hoo boy. I am stuffed!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then perhaps we shall not be interrupted by the 'cute' roaring of your stomach tonight?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Stop it! You're making it sound like it growls all the time!"
<p>We teased each other as we settled into our new room.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I see you went with the tenshu again!"
<p>I stepepd out onto the balcony for a little cool night wind against my alcohol-warmed cheeks.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Good pick. It's got a nice view."
<p>(...What's sitting in the alcove? Is that--?!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hey there, Bearsace! ...Aww, you gave him the seat of honor!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Of course. He is a necessary part of any space of mine."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hee hee!"
<p>(Seeing Bearsace in the tenshu...)
<p>(...That reminds me of my first visit to Azuchi's tenshu...)
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What's this mysterious doll? A talisman of some kind?"
<p>......
<p>(Now Bearsace likes tenshus just as much as Nobunaga! Such rich tastes, Bearsace...!)
<p>I recalled another night when it was Nobunaga and me up there--
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I wouldn't have expected your goal was to unite Japan into a single, peaceful country."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is. I expect Japan to grow rapidly as a country, becoming strong and powerful enough to stand up against all others."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "When it has, I will leave this small island and experience what the rest of the world has to offer firsthand."
<p>......
<p>(He really pulled it off.)
<p>I returned my gaze to the view below, as a gentle darkness embraced the houses in a forgiving, peaceful night.
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The first time I killed a man, I was thirteen years old."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It's kill or be killed. You only have one choice if you want to live. Thus, there's no reason to hesitate."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That's when I swore to gain enough power to put a stop to all the fighting."
<p>......
<p>(He's had to put up with such nightmarish experiences, all to get here.)
<p>I knew that there was no such thing as a world without anger and grief.
<p>We would all carry our wounds with us--how we'd been hurt, how we'd hurt others--throughout our lives.
<p>It was an inevitability. Especially in a time like this. But it doesn't have to be the sum of our lives.
<p>If you can open yourself up, a little at a time, to the world around to you, to the future, healing was possible.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You've grown quiet. What is it?"

<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You've grown quiet. What is it?"
<p>Nobunaga placed his arm low around my waist and drew me in.
<p>I shivered with pleasure at the way his lips grazed my ear.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I was just thinking back to when we met."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Oh?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The night we met..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I recall you refusing my offer while talking about some dream job of yours before throwing me off you."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "How would you like to rul the world at my side?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sorry, but I can't! I'm starting my dream job really, really soon, and, well, bye!"
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm surprised you remembered! That must not have made much sense to you, huh?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Little you said that night did. Which is perhaps why I remember it so clearly."
<p>Nobunaga ran a hand up my thigh.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mmm..."
<p>My body warmed to his touch, and I shivered.
<p>Nobunaga:</strong> "Now that you are here, how does it feel to rule the world with me?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I don't know. I've seen how much work you put into ruling the world. It feels like a lot of responsibility."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "The 'with you' part though? I think I can sum up my feelings on that succinctly."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And what are they?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Sheer bliss."
<p>Nobunaga smiled at my answer.
<p>I lay my head on his broad chest.
<p>I wanted to feel his heartbet. His life. His life up till now. Make it a part of my own.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "If I'd never met you, Nobunaga..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I'd never have known these depths of hatred and of love."
<p>The pleasure I felt when I touched him was more than I'd ever experienced in the past.
<p>That, I attributed to the power of our love. And if it felt painful at times, it was only because it was so strong.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Everything you are and everything that led you here--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "From the bottom of my heart, I love everything that makes you you..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC."
<p>Nobunaga sought my hand.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are the one who taught me so much. I would have remained a fool without you..."
<p>His fingers, so warm, tangled themselves in my own.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga..."
<p>The look in his eyes wsa scintillating.
<p>Our loose robes were brushed aside as we moved closer, clearing the way for delicious skin-to-skin contact.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I conquered your body."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I tried to conquer your heart."
<p>My back reached the wall.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But before I could--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You gave me everything."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Your body... your heart... your warmth. I know the fear of loss because of you."
<p>The yearning he felt for me, I could sense it all over him. But it, like so much else, was seen most clearly in his eyes.
<p>(I'm sure I look the same.)
<p>When you love someone, you must live alongside the fear of losing them someday.
<p>Yet you can never stop loving.
<p>(I desire you so much that I can't stand it.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Regardless of how many times the specter of death draws near, all that I am is yours."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "In the hopes that you can look back on our lives together with joy--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I entrust my life to you."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I accept."
<p>My vision grew blurry with warm tears.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Your body... your heart..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "They're mine. And I won't let them go."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I love you, MC."
<p>We were each other's. Physically. Spiritually.
<p>Not foreer. Nothing in this world lasts forever.
<p>But the happy moments when you and I could love each other like this felt endless.
<p>And as long as we were alive, we would be together to face our challenges side by side.
<p>I knew that when the end of my life came and I had to look back on it, I would smile--
<p>...and thank the heavens that I fell in love with you...
