  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Passionate - Chapter 8 (1-5)</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Hideyoshi, you idiotic monkey! What are you waiting for? Now is the time!"
<p>A powerful voice carried over the glittering darkness of the night seas.
<p>(He sounds just like--)
<p>(But... but that can't...)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Go! Capture them now!"
<p>The retreating Oda soldiers retreated no more. With a shout, they charged.
<p>Hideyoshi and Keiji led them up the gangway and onto the ship.
<p>The deck was consumed in a melee.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Tch! That ain't him, is it?"
<p>With ease that could only come of experience, Motonari leapt up and onto the ship that had crashed into ours.
<p>(Okay, but that voice! That other ship--!)
<p>I had to go there and find out for myself.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Ugh!"
<p>That grunt of pain had come from Kicho.
<p>I looked to see him pitch forward.
<p>(Who got him?! I'm not done with him myself yet! Talking, I mean!)
<p>Behind Kicho, a tall, dark, and very handsome shadow stood.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...It's..."
<p>Dressed in a familiar black kimono and with the moon at his back.
<p>(I'm not... seeing things?)
<p>Windswept and sea sprayed hair and features limned in the dim, silver light.
<p>The light's soft glow made him seem a mist-created phantom, pulled straight from my heart.
<p>Then he looked at me. And smiled.
<p>(It's...)
<p>I felt a wave of gentle heat come over me.
<p>And a stinging in the corners of my eyes.
<p>(I would recognize that gaze anywhere.)
<p>(The eyes of the man I love...)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You really followed me all the way out here, did you? You impetuous fireball..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No... bu... naga...?"
<p>I nearly fell to my feet in my attempts to reach him; but he caught me.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...A ghost? No, ghosts don't have physical bodies. Can hallucinations be physical? Am I hallucinating this?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You may theorize about my return later."
<p>(But "return" means you're back, yes?)
<p>I held his hand. It was warm. I felt for his pulse. It was there. Not that I trusted those, or myself, right now.
<p>(This isn't one of those "I'm here for a little, but then I must go leave" things, right? Don't be those, I hate those!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What happened to your hand?"
<p>Nobunaga turned my hand over in his. He frowned, looking at it.
<p>MC:</strong> "My hand? Oh, I was..."
<p>(...I was digging my nails into my skin pretty hard when we ran into Kicho.)
<p>It wasn't bleeding anymore, but the messy red crescents told everything. Nobunaga pulled me in close.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga, I--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "This is why I told you not to come."
<p>I didn't even know what to say next. And I didn't have to think of anything, either--
<p>Nobunaga's lips were upon mine.
<p>(That's Nobunaga's warmth.)
<p>I could have cried, kissing him.
<p>It was such a beautiful ethereal kiss that once again, I thought this must be a dream. Anything but reality.
<p>(Can I... believe this?)
<p>(...Not a clone, not a parallel timeline or any other contrivance? My Nobunaga is back?)

<ul>
    <li>Pinch cheek.</li>
    <li><strong>"Whatever this is...!"</strong></li>
    <li>"Don't leave again..."</li>
</ul>

<p>The breath from his lips tickled my nose after our kiss; a simple sensation that instantly made me believe.
<p>I threw my arms around him.
<p>Nobunaga held me tightly.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You know what, I don't care if it's any of those other things--!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...As long as I never, ever have to let you go again!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC."

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC."
<p>He opened his mouth to speak,
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga! Where's Kicho--?!"
<p>Hideyoshi, breathing heavily, broke away from the melee to find us.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There. He is not dead. Only wounded."
<p>Hideyoshi trussed his arms and hauled a kneeling Kicho to his feet.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Stand up!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Ugh..."
<p>(Ooh. Ouch...)
<p>What I hadn't seen before was the big, painful looking slash across Kicho's back. His white robe was more of a red splotch.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Kicho."
<p>Nobunaga ushered me behind him for safety before facing Kicho.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You obstinate ghost... How did you get here so fast?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I should have known better than to take your devil's luck lightly."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Your scheme was hardly lacking. You were merely outsmarted this time."
<p>Nobunaga withdrew his sword once more and placed the blade against Kicho's neck.
<p>I watched and waited.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What changed you, Kicho?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You were resolute, ruthless even, in your desire to see this land united and the warring put to a stop."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Did you really think I'd tell you?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "All you get to know is that, as long as I live, the Sengoku period will never come to an end."
<p>Kicho's eyes shined with wild light.
<p>(Oh, come on! You're bound up, bleeding, have a sword to your throat and you still believe in this crazy cause? Why?!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You believe you can fight me in this state?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "If it means crawling out of here on my stomach, I'll do it. Especially now that I know you still live."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "The hatred you've earned yourself will always be what keeps your ambitions of conquest from coming true."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sorry, but no. You're wrong."
<p>It was a little hard to argue with him when part of me still thought this was a dream.
<p>But if it was a dream, screw it, no reason not to say what was on my mind, right?
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "How am I wrong?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga's taken many lives. Left even more people with loved ones lost."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "The anger and rage of those who've lost someone can definitely fuel hatred and aggression. And war."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "When someone you love dies, you can become... something unrecognizable."
<p>(It happened to me. I'd never thought I could be ready to kill someone until I lived through what you did to Nobunaga.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But you still have the ability to throw off that hate and rage!"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...That's ridiculous."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Then explain to me why you're not dead!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Because the situation I've just described? That's you and me, right now."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I don't see the relation."
<p>(I used to think he was doing all this because he hated Nobunaga. But I don't think he does.)
<p>I don't think he hates anyone. I think he has a reason to cling to this time period.
<p>(But what would make someone want to choose an era of war over a future of peace?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Come on. Stop shutting me out like that! Let's talk! Have you tried talking about your problems? Like, at all?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I notice a lot of people here don't do that. But in my experience, it really helps people get a new view on life."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I'm not interested in those things."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC is right, you know."
<p>I glanced at Nobunaga, who smiled and sheathed his sword.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...What do you think you're doing? You can't be letting me go?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "No. But I will let you live."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You...?"

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "No. But I will let you live."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You...?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Just as I myself will live on to complete the unification of this newborn country."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It would be easy to kill you here."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But it would be more fun to conquer your beliefs and prove my vision to you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Besides--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...The woman I love is naive and idealistic enough to try and reach out to the man she thought had killed me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I owe it to her surprisingly persuasive ideals to try and do so as well."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga--"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "So, you'd rather kill me by breaking my spirit, is that it?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Imprison me if you like. I will never stop forcing you back into battle."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And each time you do, I will win."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "...We ready to start the party up again?!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Uh oh. Who was watching Motonari again--?"
<p>My question came far too late as a huge cloud of white smoke consumed the area.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi's Voice:</strong> "...Wait!"
<p>Motonari's Voice:</strong> "This one's coming with me!"
<p>(Argh, I can't see a thing!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, don't move!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You couldn't make me!"
<p>I followed the sound of Nobunaga's voice and clung to him hard as I could.
<p>When the wind finished carrying the smoke away, there was no more Kicho.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Aww! Where did he go?!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "They escaped by boat."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What boat? Aren't both of them--?"
<p>I followed Nobunaga's gaze past our two boats to a little dinghy just past them.
<p>Its sail was carrying it swiftly out to sea.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Didn't that dinghy come from your boat? I hope they know that's TOTALLY CHEATING!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "After them! They won't escape!"
<p>Before Hideyoshi had even said anything, the soldiers still on the docks were racing toward the jetty to man the boats.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is fine. Let them go."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "But my lord--!"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "My apologies, Lord Nobunaga."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mitsuhide?!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Mitsuhide, if you were still on Lord Nobunaga's boat, then explain how Motonari got away?!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's where he was?!"
<p>(So, someone WAS watching Motonari! Or should have been. Tsk, tsk, Mitsuhide!)
<p>(They must have fought whlie we weren't looking. At least, I assume they were...?)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "If you had but informed me of our lord's plan earlier, I might have had enough time to prepare a suitable defense."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "As it was, I was barely able to gather enough men to man a ship effectively."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "In fact, I was expecting to receive your gratitude that we dealt with Kicho so quickly and efficiently."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Gratitude?! How about you listen when I give you criticism instead of coming up with a dozen different excuses--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hey! Sorry to interrupt. I kind of need to check something for my mental health!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Nobunaga's really, really alive, and everything until now was part of a plan? That you knew about, Hideyoshi?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "MC! Listen, I, err...!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I shall explain everything to you later."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hideyoshi. Mitsuhide."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Our objective in this battle was my 'revival' and the occupation of Kicho's merchant house and the port of Sakai."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We can send men after Kicho and Motonari later. First, we must secure this battlefield."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "After you have taken Kicho's manor, we go immediately to the Mouri's stronghold."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi and Mitsuhide:</strong> "Yes, my lord."
<p>THe two of them rushed off gallantly to deal with the remainder of Motonari's forces.
<p>Nobunaga turned to me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga..."

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga..."
<p>(So, we've already confirmed other people can see and talk to him. That's good.)
<p>(That means he's real. Really real.)
<p>(...Nobunaga is alive and real.)
<p>I wondered why I hadn't been able to cry after the news that he died. Apparently, I'd been saving all the tears for now.
<p>(Ugh, yep... there I go...)
<p>(...Silly me. If I start crying now, I won't be able to see his face clearly...!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "To think you would choose to discuss things with the man you thought had killed me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There is no curing your naivete and optimism, I see."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I was...!"
<p>I was too choked up to speak.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...F-funny thing is... I only decided to talk to him because I remembered that one time..."
<p>I spoke slowly, giving the tears room to fall.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I didn't want to believe you'd died..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...When I came face-to-face with Kicho, I got so angry. Angry enough to kill..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Except that I remembered what we talked about that night in the tenshu...!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...And I wanted... Even if you weren't here with me anymore, I wanted to stay the woman you loved...!"
<p>I was bawling now. No amount of wiping my tears away seemed to slow them down.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC..."
<p>But Nobunaga's calloused thumb did a much better job drying my tears than I had.
<p>I clutched his hand and held it by my cheek.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I thought when you rode off to war... you were planning to die for my sake...!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I had considered that."
<p>(You did?!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "After talking with Sasuke, I did."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But... but you couldn't possibly die for my sake! If you died--...!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I, too, thought that tossing your life aside was the height of waste."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "However, if my life could let you keep yours... that, I thought, was not a waste."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'd never--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then I realized..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I would be hurting you more to leave you alone in the world with no answers than to stay, even if that caused you to fade away."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I feared you dying and your mourning me more than I feared my own demise."
<p>(I remember now...)
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you were to disappear, I would turn to ash without you..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Longing for you would burn my soul away."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I feel the same, you know."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...My world would lose all meaning if you weren't in it..."
<p>The look on his face...
<p>......
<p>(It was around that time...)
<p>Nobunaga had desired me that night as if it were his last night alive--then I said that, and there was a change in him.
<p>(...That must have been when he decided killing himself wasn't the answer. Well, thank God for that!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Kicho's schemes pushed back my unification and threatened your future."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But I had no desire to die, nor to pass on my great ambition to another."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I decided I had no choice but to complete my plans as quickly as possible."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "As it turned out, I was able to turn Kicho's plotting against him and to my advantage."
<p>(This. This is the Nobunaga I trusted in.)
<p>Confident. Devilishly smart. I relaxed as soon as I realized he'd got it all under control.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...But if you were alive, why didn't you tell me?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Execepting Hideyoshi, I had to fool every member of the Oda forces into believing my death for this plan to work."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...It must appear as if I have died."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "But my lord--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You will let the troops know of my death and use their anger to power a war to avenge me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "As you march upon Kicho's manor, you must let the rumors of my death spread. Do not keep it a secret."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Why choose me for this... my lord?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Mitsuhide willingly made himself unfit to be a leader. You know he is unsuitable."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Masamune and Ieyasu are Oda allies. Only an Oda vassal can take on this role."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And it must be the vassal I trust the most."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "But... that means lying... to everyone."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Even lying to MC. My lord, can't we at least let her know? She'll be devastated--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "..."

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Even lying to MC. My lord, can't we at least let her know? She'll be devastated--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "..."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There were two reasons I wished for everyone to believe I had died."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "One was so that the information would reach Kicho and Motonari and cause them to let down their guard."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The second was to boost the Oda's position in the land with my miraculous reappearance."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I told Hideyoshi to inform Mitsuhide about the plan when the time was right and have him secure a boat for us in Sakai."
<p>(I'm definitely impressed... because all this goes wayyy beyond reasonable levels of preparedness on their part.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "As for you... if you'd stayed in Azuchi as I asked, you would have never experienced the falsehood of my death to begin with."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Rumors, perhaps. No sooner to be followed by rumor of my resurrection."
<p>(He'd prepared to fake his death way back when he ordered me to stay home?!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay! Then tell me that was the plan before you left! Then I wouldn't have--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You wouldn't have chased after me?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I-I'm not saying that..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I recall how you paled when you heard the news I had been betrayed."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Even if you knew it was part of the plan, I doubt you could have stayed silent if you knew it involved my being hurt."
<p>(...I can't say anything when he's that right.)
<p>(But that was the old me. I've lived through the experience of seeing you shot. Of almost losing you.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I get it. But tell me next time."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Next time?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "With you, there probably will be a next time. And I can bear it. Because I've borne it before. Don't worry about me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I figured something out during this battle."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "There's always another option. Even when faced with blinding rage."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And no matter what enemy you face, I will be strong enough to stand at your side as you face them."
<p>(Love has made me stronger than I ever thought possible.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Just don't force me to leave your side. All right?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It seems..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...It seems I have underestimated you once again."
<p>He looked thoughtful a moment.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh?"
<p>I was just about to ask what he was thinking when we heard voices from the dock.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi's Voice:</strong> "Ieyasu! Masamune!"
<p>Ieyasu, Masamune, and the rest of the men fighting Kicho's mercenaries had emerged from Kicho's manor.
<p>The fighting on the docks had come to an end as well, the survivors bound.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm so glad everyone's okay!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes. Now, let us go."
<p>......
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Nobunaga, you... I'm... glad you're all right."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I can't believe you tricked us like that!"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "My lord... I'm so relieved."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I'm so impressed! The way you came back up from the dead, it's as if you rose up outta the sea itself!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I commend you all on securing Kicho's manor and subduing the remnants of the Mouri."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I must share my amazement at how you turned Kicho's scheme around and secured his weapons and trade route."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "MC... Though I was under orders from Lord Nobunaga, I'm so sorry for--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hey, hey, Hideyoshi. It's okay."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I mean, he's alive. And I learned a few things about myself. So it's all good."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "But..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "All good? Including the part where you jumped onto the enemy's ship? I thought you were planning to follow our lord!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I, uh, can be a little... impetuous."
<p>(Just like when I rescued Nobunaga that first time. Boy, when that adrenaline kicks in...!)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Wasn't a problem. As long as you can live to tell the story! And hey, you got a real nice smile on your face now too."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah. And thanks!"
<p>He gave my head a friendly mussing.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Heh!"
<p>Before I could reach to smooth my hair back into place, Nobunaga pulled me away.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Hm? Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC is free to be with who she likes."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But that does not mean I wlil ever part with her, especially not to you."
<p>(Part with--? Oh, Nobunaga!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Come on! Keiji's just being friendly!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Understood, my lord."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Keiji! Don't pretend to take him seriously! You two are both being silly now!"
<p>The two nodded at each other, and I hoped it was for some inside joke only they understood.
<p>(Boys thinking boys and girls can't be friends without it meaning something...)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hideyoshi, Mitsuhide. See the troops get their rest. We depart with the dawn."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi and Mitsuhide:</strong> "Yes, my lord."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Come with me."

    <p>The small boat glided across the water, leaving rippled reflections of the soft pinks, purples, and oranges of the coming dawn.
    <p>Nobunaga and I had come here from Sakai's port to rest in tis little inlet.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's so quiet now..."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes."
    <p>Those had been the first words we'd exchanged since he'd rowed us out here.
    <p>(Nobunaga's not usually this quiet.)
    <p>(Maybe he's--?)
    <p>......
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It seems..."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...It seems I have underestimated you once again."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh?"
    <p>......
    <p>(He might still be thinking about whatever it was he was going to say back there.)
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You once told me..."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...that every moment i was alive meant something good to you."
    <p>......
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What were you thinking?! Were you throwing your life away?"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "No, of course I wasn't. I was saving yours!"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What benefit is it to you to be so concerned about me?"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Because I would hate it if you died!"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "My heart would break forever if I lost you!"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I want you to live! Every moment you're alive means something good to me!"
    <p>......
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I remember that..."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yet, when I thought I might lose you, fear overcame me and, if only for a moment, I thought my only choice was to die."
    <p>(It's rare for him to reflect on a painful feeling like this.)
    <p>I offered him a quiet, supportive ear.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I knew how resilient you are."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "No matter what difficulties came our way, you stubbornly chose to stand with me."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I left you in Azuchi because--"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I did not want to see you suffer."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I..."
    <p>His low voice was hoarse, and it was hard to hear him sound so mournful.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The idea of you in pain is unbearable."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If I have... one weakness--"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...it would be your sadness..."
    <p>(A weakness...)
    <p>I wasn't sure I'd ever heard him even toy with the idea of having a weakness.
    <p>He'd discarded his own regret and sadness. All to remain strong in the face of anything.
    <p>But he was telling me he had a weakness. He was exposing that weakness TO me.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And yet, my weakness caused you sadness..."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am... sorry that I made you suffer."
    <p>(Of course... If anything could have been plaguing his mind for so long--)
    <p>I remembered the look he gave me then.
    <p>(It would be finding the words to apologize to me. Oh, Nobunaga...)
    <p>He looked more and more like a penitent child. Though it was only his emotions that had been frozen in time...
    <p>(You are just--)
    <p>(...You have no idea how sweet you are.)
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "You don't need to agonize over this."
    <p>I placed my hand on his, curled so tightly around the oar.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Like I told you before, this whole adventure gave me confidence."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "So don't be sad yourself now."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Smile."
    <p>I gave him a quick kiss.
    <p>...Which quickly intensified.
    <p>Nobunaga paused for breath--
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mmm...!"
    <p>Then he drew me onto his lap, keeping me close so that he might kiss me deeper.
    <p>(I love you.)
    <p>(I love that you love me.)
    <p>(I even love that you're a little awkward about it.)
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What... should I have done instead?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Should I have told you my fear when it first took hold of my heart?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...When I look back on that time, I feel as if a serpent is choking me..."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Though if I'd been able to keep you inside the castle as I planned, you would have suffered less..."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Perhaps my failure was being too lax in your security?"
    <p>He continued to question himself, his brows knit tightly together.
    <p>(For Sasuke's health and job safety, I'm not going to tell you to put in more guards.)
    <p>(Actually, I should probably not mention Sasuke at all right now!)
    <p>Not while Nobunaga was taking the matter of my escape and his failure so seriously.
    <p>Suddenly, it came to me that he looked this same way when looking for a counter after I pulled off a clever move in Go.
    <p>(Silly Nobunaga. All I care about is that you're alive.)
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you have no intention of accepting my apology, then you force my hand."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I have no choice but to promise you that this will be the last time you face such solitude and--"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wait, wait. Stop."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You stopped me?"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I want to hear it, just, you know... later."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Later when?"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...When I beat you in Go, of course! Then I'll make you say what you were going to promise me here."
    <p>He blinked cutely.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I would prefer nothing else."
    <p>Now he was smiling.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will complete my unification."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And I will save your life."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I swear it."
    <p>(I trust you.)
    <p>For a moment, I wondered how it hadn't broken me, being this in love with someone.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Of course you will."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "If anyone can do it, you can."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "And you've got me."
    <p>I stroked his hair down smooth; silver and black with a touch of gold from the dawn.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Yes."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mmm."
    <p>He smiled and kissed me gently.
    <p>This was the warmth I thought I'd lost forever. He was proving to me slowly that I lost nothing. Only gained.
    <p>And the knowledge of that brought happy tears to my eyes...
