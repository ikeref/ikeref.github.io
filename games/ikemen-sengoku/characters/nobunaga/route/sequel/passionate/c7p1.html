  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Passionate - Chapter 7 (1-5)</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>???:</strong> "...wake..."
<p>(Who is it?)
<p><strong>???:</strong> "MC..."
<p>(Is that you, Nobunaga? Oh, thank goodness. You woke up!)
<p>(I was so worried that you'd--)
<p><strong>???:</strong> "MC? Please wake up."
<p>I jolted up only to see Mitsunari peering at me worriedly.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mitsunari? Where's--?"
<p>I glanced at the tent flap. Sunlight was shining through.
<p>(It's morning already.)
<p>(Right... I passed out...)
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I would have let you rest, but you were moaning n your sleep and I was worried."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Are you... all right?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm okay. Thanks for checking on me. Anything happen while I was sleeping?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Only that Lord Hideyoshi was asking everyone to gather for some reason."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Got it. I'll be there too."
<p>I followed Mitsunari outside.
<p>Last night, at sunset, camp had been full of rousing cheers of victory and a celebratory atmosphere. That was gone now.
<p>(Something up? Or rather--)
<p>The Oda forces were all gathered.
<p>The familiar warlords were there too.
<p>Standing at their head was... Hideyoshi.
<p>(...Nothing's changed from last night. Nobunaga must still be unconscious.)
<p>However, I felt this awful unease I couldnn't explain, like being stuck with cold needles.
<p>Hideyoshi let out a long breath, as if savoring the brief moments before he had to speak.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...I didn't want to have to give you this news after yesterday's victory. I didn't ever want to have to give this news."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I think I must have spent the hours before dawn just praying that this would fall to anyone but me."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "But--"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...It's always a possibility when someone is injured. And I was the last at his side."
<p>("The last at his side?")
<p>Frenetic murmurs passed through the crowd. To me, it was all noise.
<p>(What's Hideyoshi... what's he... saying?)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga has passed away."
<p>("Lord Nobunaga has p...")
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Wha--?!"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Mm."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Gh!"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "...What?"
<p>(C-could he say that again? No. No, don't. I don't... I don't want to hear what I think I heard...)
<p>I felt sick. My world was grinding to a halt, jerking and screeching all the while and me, there, helplessly along for the ride.
<p>Everyone else was moving through this-- this disaster in slow motion. All was silent.
<p>Silent but for my thoughts. I repeated the news a hundred thousand times in the space it took someone to speak.
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 1:</strong> "That can't be!"
<p>Someone's shout shattered the silence.
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 2:</strong> "Right? L-Lord Hideyoshi's too calm. So it can't be true."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 3:</strong> "Meaning... it's just a joke? That's it? C'mon, don't scare us like that!"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier 4:</strong> "This is part of our next plan, is it? We gotta pretend that our lord is really--"
<p>A shaky, dry laughter spread amongst a couple of the men. No one believed it. No one wanted to.
<p>I didn't want to.
<p>(Such a mean joke, Hideyoshi. Why would you lie and tell me--)
<p>Tell me I'd never look into those eyes again.
<p>Tell me I'd never see that proud smile again.
<p>Tell me I'd never hear that deep voice again.
<p>Tell me that that beautiful heart encased in layers of cold ice...
<p>...had stopped beating before I had a chance to fully free it...
<p>Should heaven and earth and the oceans risen up to swallow him, I should have split them apart to keep him near...!
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "That's enough damned laughter!!"
<p>It was so sudden I jumped at the sound.
<p>Hideyoshi's roar froze us all in stillness.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You don't want to believe it? Well guess what?! I don't want to believe it either!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You think I'd stand here in front of you all and joke about something like this?! Do you have any idea what this feels like?!"

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You think I'd stand here in front of you all and joke about something like this?! Do you have any idea what this feels like?!"
<p>The calm around him had been shattered. Not a man believed he was kidding when they heard how his voice quaked.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Our next battle is to avenge him."
<p>Quiet and cool as his next words were, they melted the ice around everyone.
<p>And beneath that ice was a boiling cauldron, spewing out billowing steam.
<p>(...We're doing... what?)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "On his deathbed, our lord named the one responsible for his fall: Kicho!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We will head out to destroy the masterming behind his assassination!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "It won't be easy. Our enemies lie in wait for us. But Lord Nobunaga will never rest until we see this done!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I know you're sad. I know you're angry. Channel those emotions into your fighting spirit! Now's the time to rise!"
<p>A great chorus of roaring voices shook the earth. Yet I remained still.
<p>(...I don't... I don't get it.)
<p>How could they even find their voices? Where I was, there was nothing. No light. Not even sound.
<p>(Channel your sadness? Channel your anger? ...What am I supposed to channel if I don't feel... anything?)
<p>Everyone started moving. Preparing for the next battle.
<p>(They move like men possessed...)
<p>I watched them, their expressions livid. Every mustcle in their bodies put to the task of avenging their lord.
<p>I felt like a ghost. Detached from reality.
<p>(Maybe... maybe I just don't want to face reality though...)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Keiji? What's wrong?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "What's wrong with you is more like it."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You didn't jump on Hideyoshi with questions. I figured you'd be demanding to see Nobunaga's... you know, him right now."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Mm..."
<p>(Yeah.)
<p>(I want to see him. I want to...)
<p>I turned my head in the direction of his tent. I very politely pushed myself forward, but my legs very politely refused to move.
<p>(...I don't want to.)
<p>I knew why.
<p>(If I go see him, then I'll know.)
<p>(I mean, I trust Hideyoshi, so the truth is undeniable. But still--)
<p>(I want to believe he's still alive...)
<p>......
<p>I found solace in my memories. Those happy months we spent together. So few of them, in retrospect.
<p>This memory was just before Azuchi Castle had been attacked. I was preparing for a long trip to acquire some more fabric.
<p>(I had leaving Azuchi, even if it's only for a few days. Shame we don't have cars. I'd be back later today.)
<p>I'd woken up early and was looking around the tenshu, taking a mental picture of it to keep with me while I was gone--
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You are not to leave our bed without my permission."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wha--!"
<p>Strong arms wrapped around me from behind and held me snugly.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I wasn't going to leave without saying goodbye! I was letting you sleep."
<p>As I lay my head against his chest, Nobunaga leg his own head rest atop mine.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That changes nothing."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Even if you are in my arms when I awake, you have still left them while I sleep."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you must leave, then you may wake me to ask for permission."

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you must leave, then you may wake me to ask for permission."
<p>(Oh, my love. What would your enemies say if they knew the big bad Devil King was actually a BIG BABY...!)
<p>I couldn't help but laugh at how silly Nobunaga was being right now.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Tell me why I need your permission--and make it good--or I refuse."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You wish to know why?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is simple. Because I have discovered how inefficient sleeping alone is."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I sleep too lightly when you are not with me. It is not restful and I become more exhausted throughout the day."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay. And--?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You demand more?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Give me something other than inefficiency. If you can't... it's no deal."
<p>(I know I'm pushing him today. He has such trouble putting his feelings into words.)
<p>But when I challenged him to search for it, by gosh, he seemed to be doing it.
<p>He spent a few moments in though, as if he were literally digging for the right words.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...When I wake up... to see you aren't there... I..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I feel... a strange chill inside me..."
<p>(So, to him, loneliness equals cold.)
<p>I tucked that information away for later.

<ul>
    <li>"I'll be better."</li>
    <li>"No getting cold."</li>
    <li><strong>"Okay then."</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm satisfied. Okay then, it's a deal."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Good."
<p>Nobunaga smiled with relief and planted a sweet kiss on the back of my neck.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hee! Still, it's sad to hear that sleeping alone has become so inefficient now."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Will you be all right when I'm not here?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hmph."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are trying to force me to admit that I am helpless without you, is that it?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Force?! Never! ...Well, I might take it as a compliment."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "As I suspected."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No, you've got me all wrong!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then what was that smug look on your face just now?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That was--"
<p>(...That was me being smug. Yep.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You got me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Honestly, it makes me feel good to know that you both love and need me."
<p>I started to blush at the wide-eyed look of surprise he gave me.
<p>Then he gently placed his hand upon my breast, where my heart lay.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not feel so self-conscious about that."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is true that there is a part of me so greatly affected by your presence that I lose all perspective without you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But you should be proud of that, whether I am with you or alone."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "For you possess what no one else has. You possess the life of Nobunaga Oda."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Until the day your own heart stops."
<p>......
<p>(He can't have died...)
<p>(I mean, my heart still beats, doesn't it?)
<p>...Barely. But maybe barely was enough? I forced myself to begin walking.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "MC?"

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "MC? That's the wrong way."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm not going to see him yet."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You don't wanna see Nobunaga...?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Because my heart hasn't given up on the hope that he's still alive."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "If I see his... if I see him and see that it was just foolish hope, I..."
<p>I couldn't even finish speaking the thought.
<p>Even thinking about what I left unsaid was enough to tear me in two.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Anyway, if I see him like this, I don't think I'd last the week."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I think I'd just die on the spot..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...MC..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "So I can't see him..."
<p>My voice was quaking.
<p>(I feel like I might cry. Except that no tears are coming to my eyes.)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...I gotcha."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "What comes next then?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Next?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I mean, are you gonna stay here? Go back with an escort to Azuchi? Or..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Are you gonna go with us to get revenge?"
<p>(Me? Get revenge...?)
<p>It went against all my morals. But here, at my weakest, it had a strange allure I'd never felt before.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What are you going to do?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I'm going to Sakai. I've gotta do something with this anger, and I figure kicking the crap out of Kicho's a good start."
<p>(Kicho...)
<p>......
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Because you are the spark that keeps the flames of war burning."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "As long as you remain alive, the world you are seeking will never come to pass."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Thus, in punishment for your crimes, you will spend your life doing just that."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You will live and keep this country engulfed in war."
<p>......
<p>(He told Nobunaga he would "live and keep this country engulfed in war".)
<p>Thinking of Kicho finally brought something resembling an emotion to the surface.
<p>(He blamed Nobunaga for causing wars, when he was the one who brought this huge mess about in the first place...)
<p>(...Nobunaga wouldn't have even BEEN here if it weren't for him!)
<p>...That emotion was rage.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi's Voice:</strong> "Careful with that!"
<p>Startled by the sound, I looked over to see what Hideyoshi was shouting about.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What are they--? ...!"
<p>Black armor. Nobunaga's black armor, being carried out of his tent.
<p>It had the vague form of a person, but in the end, it was just an empty shell.
<p>(...I... I can't...)
<p>Seeing it was like coming face-to-face with the knowledge that he was really gone.
<p>My world was being torn apart by loss of everything I loved in the world.
<p>(I can't face that he's not here.)
<p>(...I can't go back to Azuchi...)
<p>(I don't want to see our home and know that he'll never walk those halls again.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'll go to Sakai too."
<p>(If it's between embracing my rage or embracing the void, I chose rage.)
<p>(...It's pretty much all I've got left..)
<p>Keiji looked at me, worried.

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'll go to Sakai too."
<p>Keiji looked at me, worried.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Not on my own, of course. I'll go with you guys, if you'll have me along."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hideyoshi's the one you'll want to be talking to, not me."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "But I'll go with you."
<p>Keiji escorted me over to Hideyoshi; despite his busy new station, he agreed to spare some time for us.
<p>......
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Absolutely not."
<p>I'd barely finished when he shot me down.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We have no idea what Kicho's planning. I can't take you into a battle with unknown dangers."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "All battles have unknown dangers. I know the risks. Please, let me go."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...MC, be reasonable."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm only asking you the same."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hideyoshi, you have to know... I can't go back to Azuchi in this state..."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "MC..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I know I'm chasing a phantom but it's the only thing I've got holding me together."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I don't want to be mean, but--"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Do you think putting you in danger is what Lord Nobunaga would have wanted?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Maybe not. But if I was talking to him right now? I wouldn't back down."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Not until he told me, 'You're as fesity as ever. Very well, I allow it.' Then he'd smile."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...MC, don't put me in this position."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You know I need to go. Please."
<p>I fixed my eyes on him, hoping to convey just how important this was to me.
<p>Hideyoshi frowned. He turned away from me, but at that moment--
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I'm asking you too, Hideyoshi."
<p>Keiji spoke up for me.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You too, Keiji?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I'll guard her."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You won't have any worries that way."
<p>(Thanks for the support, Keiji.)
<p>I was amazed that Keiji, in this difficult time, still had the energy to devote to others.
<p>(I can barely keep myself together.)
<p>They weren't discussing the sense of it like Hideyoshi and I had.
<p>Whatever their argument for my going or not was happening in those silent gazes.
<p>But [Keiji's] seemed to work, because after a few seconds, Hideyoshi sighed.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "All right. You can come along."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "MC, I want you to be with either Keiji or me at ALL times. Got it?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Got it. And thank you."
<p>I bowed to him, then to Keiji.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thank you too, Keiji."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Nah. Was nothing."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Just something I wanted to do."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We depart immediately and will assault Kicho's merchant house with the dawn."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You two will accompany my division."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You got it, boss."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Sounds great."
<p>......
<p>We left the battlefield and rode all through the night.
<p>I was happy we didn't have any breaks.
<p>As long as I was focused on keeping up with everyone, I didn't have to think about anything else.
<p>......
<p>(That's Kicho's merchant house? ...A bit more than a "house", if you ask me.)
<p>Oda soldiers blocked off every road leading to and away from it.
<p>The people of Sakai ran inside, shut their doors, and extinguished their lights as we entered the city.
<p>Almost as if they knew what was coming.
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I thought he'd have this place packed full of mercenaries in preparation for us."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Instead it's quiet. Too quiet."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey, uh, what're the chances he's not here?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Our spies said that Kicho was seen entering and exiting his manor as normal, during and after the battle."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Don't suppose his strategy is to wait here politely and get crushed?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "If it is, then that's what he'll get."
<p>(Everyone's ready to tear Kicho limb from limb... Good.)
<p>Everyone's animosity, everyone's muderous rage choked the air.
<p>I'd been hanging by a thread, so it wasn't like I'd been watching the others--
<p>...But I saw now how Nobunaga's loss had shaken even his best warlords to their foundations.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Ieyasu, don't let your emotions get the best of you."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Uh huh. Says the guy holding his sword so tightly I can hear it rattling."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Too bad all the tea houses closed when we came marching in, cause I think you two could use a drink."
<p>Even Keiji, with his jokes, had his gaze fixed sharply on Kicho's manor.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Lord Hideyoshi? Where is Lord Mitsuhide? He seems to have disappeared sometime during our march."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Mitsuhide's fine. He took a few men to look for any hidden escape routes outside the manor."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Lord Hideyoshi, we have the building surrounded."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Thanks for the update."
<p>Hideyoshi took another scouring look at the manor before addressing the soldiers.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We'll storm in through the front. Our only objective is Kicho. Today's the day--"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...We get our revenge."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Everyone ready?"
<p>(...We'd better be.)
<p>(Ugh. I don't relish seeing Kicho again. Just thinking about him makes me tremble.)
<p>Where my feelings would lead me should I see him again... I did not know.
<p>(All I can do is follow my heart.)
<p>(...Until it stops beating.)
