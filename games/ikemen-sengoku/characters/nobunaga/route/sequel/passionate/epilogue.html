  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Passionate - Epilogue</h1>

  <h2>Part 1</h2>
  <p>(I heard Spanish! No, wait, sorry. That would be Portuguese. They do sound similar...)
  <p>It had been several months since we moved from Azuchi Castle to Osaka Castle.
  <p>And right now, Nobunaga, Hideyoshi, and I were on a baot! A big foreign one. Hooray for proximity to the ocean!
  <p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Are you okay, MC? You're not bored? You don't have to stay. I can give you some money to shop in town if--"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Bored? No way!"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I can't tell you how much I love watching this!"
  <p>One of Nobunaga's stated goals after unification was to go abroad and see the world. While he hadn't left yet--
  <p>...We'd used Sakai, liberated from the still missing Kicho, as a base of operations for renewed foreign trade.
  <p>Foreign trade also meant opportunities for cultural exchange. Sakai was on its way to becoming quite the international hub!
  <p>(And Nobunaga's picking it up quick!)
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Esta... carne... seca...?"
  <p><strong>Merchant:</strong> "O, sim! É carne seca! Carne de vaca seca!"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Vaca... Cow? So, dried cow meat..."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I have eaten cow meat before. It was tough but hearty. Now what is this?"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga is really loving this!"
  <p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Yes, he is."
  <p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We used to bring an interpreter along with us on every trip, but recently he's preferred to do it himself."
  <p>(Well, they say immersion is the best way to learn! And Nobunaga's super smart!)
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Me... monstre. Isso..."
  <p>(Look at him! His eyes are sparkling! He's like a kid in a candy shop!)
  <p>Considering he had the Portuguese to thank for his favorite sugar candy, I guess I shouldn't have been surprised.
  <p>But it was clear that even without the sugar, Nobunaga enjoyed talking with people from abroad.
  <p>(He's become a lot more expressive too.)
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I could watch him forever..."
  <p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Fallen in love again, have you? I know our lord is great, but--"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, God! I said that aloud, didn't I?"
  <p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You did, but it would have been obvious even if you'd kept your throughts to yourself."
  <p>(Sigh...)
  <p>I was a little embarrassed; Hideyoshi patted my head consolingly.
  <p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Anyway, as long as you're enjoying yourself."
  <p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga tends to take a while, so you may want to sit down while you wait."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thanks. I'll do that."
  <p>I smiled and watched Hideyoshi return to assisting Nobunaga.
  <p>(Oh, for a working smartphone with a translation app on it! Guess I'm going to have to study the hard way...)
  <p><strong>Foreign Sailor:</strong> "Hola, bonita! Estas sola?"
  <p>(Oh, one of the sailors! Here for a chat?)
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hola! Mi... uh..."
  <p>Sadly, that was as far as I got.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I'm sorry..."
  <p>The man laughed a friendly laugh, shook his head, and tried again. Slower, I noted.
  <p><strong>Foreign Sailor:</strong> "Cómo te llamas?"
  <p>("Te" is "you"? ...Ugh, I wish I understood better! Or that my school had taught anything other than English and Japanese...)
  <p>He sat down beside me. He was buff, with tanned skin, dark hair.
  <p><strong>Foreign Sailor:</strong> "Your... name?"
  <p>(Oh, name! He's asking for my name!)
  <p>(Nothing weird about engaging in some cultural exchange myself!)
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "My name is--"
  <p>The man leaned in closer. Really close. Then I thought I saw him ready to slip a familiar arm around me--
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Who do you think you are touching?"

  <h2>Part 2</h2>
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Who do you think you are touching?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Nobunaga! ...Wait, that wasn't my answer. My name ISN'T Nobunaga!"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "His name is--!"
  <p>(...Uh, his name is "very angry warlord".)
  <p>I nearly jumped in surprise when I saw the look on his face.
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Embora."
  <p>Nobunaga glared at the sailor.
  <p>(I don't know that word, but it doesn't take a polyglot to know it mean "scram!")
  <p><strong>Foreign Sailor:</strong> "Ah, tchau!"
  <p>The sailor leapt up to go, shooting me a wink before he left though.
  <p>(...When Nobunaga's giving you a death glare? It really does take guts to be a sailor!)
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We may be here to trade, but you are not a trade good."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes? Um, clearly..."
  <p>It was my turn to be glared at.
  <p>(What? ...What?! You're mad at me?!)
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That man was obviously flirting with you, and you were about to tell him your name."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...WAS he flirting? I can't understand Portuguese! I'm a little surprised you understand Portuguese flirting, actually."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It was obvious."
  <p>(Not at first, but yeah. That arm trick was definitely a lead into something--)

  <ul>
    <li><strong>"Sorry if it bothered you."</strong></li>
    <li>"I didn't realize."</li>
    <li>"How were you sure?"</li>
  </ul>

  <p>That explained why Nobunaga was upset. He was jealous and probably a little bit worried for me.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I wouldn't have let him get away with it. Sorry if what you saw bothered you."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is fine now that I know you are all right."
  <p>He wasn't upset anymore. There was only contentment on his face.
  <p>Apologetically, perhaps, he touched a kiss to my cheek.
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It seems I must engage in more foreign displays of affection so that they will understand our relationship as well."
  <p>The look on Nobunaga's face? Now that was a flirtatious look. I fell for it instantly.
  <p>(I don't think you lack for PDA skills! Heck, I'm from the modern day, and you still surprise me with the stuff you pull!)
  <p>But I let him do some thinking out loud.
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What troubles me is that those things are harder to understand than their words."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "You mean body language and gestures?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes. Such as that sailor. When he departed, he closed one eye. A curious action."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...You mean when he winked?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You know it? Explain this 'wink' to me."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "O-oh, come on! You know what winking is, Nobunaga! ...You do know, right...?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "When do you 'wink' at someone?"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Um, well, if you really don't know, it's... I guess it's what you do to communicate something private without saying it aloud."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "That thing could be 'Just between you and me!' or 'Good going!' or 'Love you!' or..."
  <p>Nobunaga was staring at me again.
  <p>Then his expression changed curiously.
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Te amo."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "What does that mean?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It means 'I love you'."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If I am going to tell you I love you, I will never go without saying it aloud."
  <p>For my part, I found that far more attractive. Especially when he smiled.
  <p>(Talk about a guy who's got nothing to worry about!)
  <p>Yet this competitive side of him had me barely restraining a smile.
  <p>I'd seen so many delightful new sides of Nobunaga lately, and I was loving it.
  <p>(How much more can a girl fall for you, Nobunaga?)
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am leaving the rest to Hideyoshi. We will retire to the manor for the day."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ooh!"
  <p>My heart was throbbing as I followed him off the boat.
  <p><strong>Villager:</strong> "Look! It's Lord Nobunaga!"
  <p><strong>Fisherman:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga! I just got some fresh fish in, if you're interested!"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I see you're being productive."
  <p>Nobunaga's frequent visits to Sakai meant he was a familiar face to its citizens.
  <p><strong>Merchant:</strong> "Princess, would you like one?"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh... Thank you."
  <p>(I'm happy to see they're getting to know me as well.)
  <p>I took the somewhat frightening looking stick of whole dried octopus "gratefully."
  <p><strong>???:</strong> "If it ain't MC! And our lord!"

  <h2>Part 3</h2>
  <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "If it ain't MC! And our lord!"
  <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Visiting the foreign ships again?"
  <p>I heard Keiji and Ieyasu. Turning, I saw Masamune with them too.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah. What's everyone else up to?"
  <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...I might possibly have some interest in some rare medicinal goods that've appeared on the market."
  <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Me? I came here looking for Lord Nobunaga. Speaking of, my lord, mind if I borrow your ear for a moment?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Go ahead. MC, will you wait for me?"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'll be here."
  <p>They moved to the shade of a store roof and began talking about something.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "What about you, Masamune?"
  <p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I'm just out and about for the sport of it. Ran into Ieyasu on my walk."
  <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "And while I kept walking faster, for some reason, you didn't stop following me."
  <p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Of course not. When you go shopping with a group, you got that many more eyes to spot good deals!"
  <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "I'm not getting much of an advantage with you then. Worse, you're a distraction."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Haha!"
  <p>Glad to see they were still getting along.
  <p>Meanwhile, Nobunaga and Keiji seemed to finish with their discussion.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "You two done?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes."
  <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey, MC? You look a little sunburnt."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Do I?"
  <p>(Well, someone else would be the first to notice, I suppose!)
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I guess I do feel a little warm."
  <p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "How many days in a row have you been visiting the ships with our lord?"
  <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "It needn't take days. Depending on the type of skin you have, you can burn or tan very quickly."
  <p>I looked down at my arms.
  <p>(I suppose I might be picking up some color. Lack of quality mirrors makes changes hard to see.)
  <p>Speaking of things we lacked here! Suncreen. Sun hats. Shades!
  <p>And when it got this hot, you can bet I rolled up my kimono as much as was, uh, "period appopriate".
  <p>(That plus the strength of the sun reflecting off the water would do it.)
  <p>(I slathered on the sunscreen when I went to the beach in the modern day, so I don't know how well I burn or tan!)
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm not that red, am I?"
  <p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Nah. Only when you're looking for it."
  <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Which makes me question why Keiji noticed so quickly."
  <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Me? I've just got good eyesight."
  <p>Nobunaga was looking at me now.
  <p>(...I suppose tans are rare, considering the "don't be seen" style most girls dress in while traveling in this time period?)
  <p>I wondered sometimes about the local beauty standards. I hadn't had any reason to pay attention to them before.
  <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I didn't make you self-conscious, did I?"
  <p><strong>Keiji was peering at me now.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "About my body? Nope! Sunburns or no, I'm as happy with me as I could be."
  <p>Old-fashioned beliefs in "beauty" had nothing to do with me, and I wouldn't let them bother me.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm not ashamed to get a little red when it happened spending the day with Nobunaga!"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Well, if I get burned, that's no fun."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "But that too, I take as a mark of pride!"
  <p>Glancing at Nobunaga, I saw his eyes widen.
  <p>Looking at him reminded me--it was confidence that was attractive. And happiness.
  <p>And I was very happy.
  <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Uh-huh."
  <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "If I knew it was only gonna launch you into a speech about our lord, I would've saved us all the trouble of asking!"

  <h2>Part 4</h2>
  <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "If I knew it was only gonna launch you into a speech about our lord, I would've saved us all the trouble of asking!"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Haha! That's what you get for bringing it up in the first place!"
  <p>Keiji laughed. I smiled.
  <p>......
  <p>The roar of the ocean sounded in the distance...
  <p>We returned to the manor. Nobunaga gave out a few orders to his vassals and then, when we were alone, reclined on the sofa.
  <p>(We may have lost Kicho, but we got to keep his cool stuff! And that couch of his? That was a definite win.)
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Good job today."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And you? Are you still well?"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Well as well can be."
  <p>Nobunaga drew me onto the couch with him.
  <p>We sank back into the cushions, and Nobunaga pressed his lips against mine.
  <p>There was nothing wrong with making out on a futon, or a nice sturdy tatami. But leather? Ohh, that could be addictive...
  <p>And we'd made many good memories here already. Such that I was already twinging with need for him.
  <p>Letting me knees sink in on either side of his legs, I loosely slung my arms around Nobunaga's neck.
  <p>We kissed again, a cascade of moans spilling forth from my warmed lips...
  <p>Before I knew it, Nobunaga had his hands around me waist, undoing my obi tie.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, yess..."
  <p>The silk fell open, the robe sliding off my shifting shoulders, giving Nobunaga more room to explore me.
  <p>(We were out in the sun all day, but it can't compare to the warmth of his hands.)
  <p>I closed my eyes in ecstasy.
  <p>The feel of him, on my arms, my legs...
  <p>I couldn't help but notice, the movements of his hands--it was like he was following a particular trail across my body.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mm... Nobunaga?"
  <p>I glanced down at him. Now he was exploring my neckline.
  <p>His long fingers traced another line over my bared skin.
  <p>(Oh. My "tan" lines.)
  <p>He moved between the parts of my skin that had gotten sun and those that had stayed protected.
  <p>Then he began tracing those lines again.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mmm... that tickles..."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...This part of you is for my eyes alone."
  <p>He kissed my upper arm, right where the color changed occurred. Then he lightly sucked on those same sun-kissed parts.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mnn!"
  <p>I squeezed him tighter with my knees, quivering at the sensitivity of my skin.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...This... this might sound silly, and I'm not too concerned but... do you have a preference for certain skin tones?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "A foolish question."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ahh!"
  <p>He gave my thigh a quick pinch. Half-scolding, half-teasing. I trembled again.
  <p>Nobunaga:</strong> "...My preference is for you. The color of your skin, the state of your body, none of that matters to me."
  <p>He kissed up and down the length of my arm, his hands caressing and cherishing the region from my stomach to my thighs.
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And any change that occurs--"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...only provides me with another new part of you to love."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga returned his eyes to mine. That carnelian red was glowing hot with desire.
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You showed pride in your body. That, I found highly attractive."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Which is why I want to celebrate your confidence and your beauty--all of it."
  <p>(You're amazing, you know.)
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I want you to know I feel the same."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You do?"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "No matter what you look like, and no matter how you might change--"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I would love you and find you attractive and I'll continue to do so."
  <p>I cupped his cheeks.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Because it's what's on the sinside. The way you show such innocent glee when you encounter foreign goods--"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...the way you're there to protect me from men with... dubious intentions; and what a badass you look like when you do."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Those are the parts I love."
  <p>I want to discover more about you, inside and out. It's such fun.
  <p>A joyful journey that never ends.
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC..."

  <h2>Part 5</h2>
  <p>Nobunaga turned us around on the couch so that he was lying on top of me, and I was the one on the smooth leather.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ooh, this feels... ahh..."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you wish, I will show you more."
  <p>The light streaming in from outside cast Nobunaga in the warm hues of sunset.
  <p>His hair was in handsome disarray and maintained its windswept look even when he ran a hand through it.
  <p>But I liked him wild like this.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Nobunaga, ahh! Give it... to me...!"
  <p>My heat prepped by the massaging of those calloused fingers, my back against the couch, I thrust up my hips.
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Keep looking."
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Look into my eyes as I do, so I can see the look on your face as you drown in me."
  <p>Our heated moans, the meeting of our flesh as we came together, I can't say they all disappeared with the roaring of the waves...
  <p>But as we made love even past the sinking of the sun beyond the horizon, it was hard to care about the noise.
  <p>All we cared about was each other.
  <p>Several days after that...
  <p>(It's been nothing but audience after audience since early this morning.)
  <p>(...Not that I'm complaining! It's peaceful. Way better than "We're under attack!")
  <p>(But I wonder if Nobunaga is bored?)
  <p>He sat on the dais, while I sat a short distance away.
  <p>I peeked at him.
  <p>Noticing, he glanced at me now.
  <p>(Heh.)
  <p>I shot him a smile.
  <p>He frowned.
  <p>Nobunaga seemed to consider something.
  <p>Then, he winked at me.
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Ahh!"
  <p>He only smirked as I broke the silence.
  <p>It was a smile that reached his eyes.
  <p>Then, he turned away and was back to his serious work expression.
  <p>(He winked at me! Nobunaga!)
  <p>......
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...You mean when he winked?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You know it? Explain this 'wink' to me."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "O-oh, come on! You know what winking is, Nobunaga! ...You do know, right...?"
  <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "When do you 'wink' at someone?"
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Um, well, if you really don't know, it's... I guess it's what you do to communicate something private without saying it aloud."
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "That thing could be 'Just between you and me!' or 'Good going!' or 'Love you!' or..."
  <p>......
  <p>(Whether he knew about it before or not, he's definitely decided to weaponize it!)
  <p><strong>MC:</strong> "You are a dangerous man, Nobunaga..."
  <p>I spoke softly, so no one would hear.
  <p>He might have heard though, as he was smiling that victorious smile once more.
  <p>I turned my attention to the blue sky outside in an attempt to focus.
  <p>(Flirting like this, you'll make me fall in love with you again and again.)
  <p>My heart beating wildly, I was sure of that...
