  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Blissful Route (Epilogue)</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wait, ack!"
<p>But that cry, sweet as it could be--I supposed--waited for no woman.
<p>A certain pushy hawk rubbed against my face, seemingly with the goal of throwing me off balance and sending me tumbling.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Get ahold of yourself. Unless you want Haguro to knock you off the horse?"
<p>It was an otherwise lovely afternoon.
<p>We and a few guards had gone hawking and were heading back now via a trail that passed through a small village.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Don't laugh! Help me!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He is only displaying his affection. I see no reason to stop him or help you."
<p>And yet, Nobunaga had the hawking glove. He was the one in control of where Haguro sat. I think he just liked tormenting me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is not painful to you, is it?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No. It's just like having a really rambunctious feather pillow try to... ack!"
<p>...Try to nibble on me! Haguro was nipping at my ear, where I was quite sensitive.
<p>(Okay! That... that doesn't quite hurt, but--!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "H-Haguro! Enough! T-that... that tickles!"
<p>I threw up my hands to protect myself.
<p>Suddenly, there was nothing to bat away.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga? Where--?"
<p>I saw that Nobunaga had raised his glove and Haguro up and out of my way.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "While it had been entertaining to see Haguro trouble you--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...It is not entertaining to have someone other than myself tickle you."
<p>He released the reins for a moment to covetously stroke my nibbled-on ear.
<p>(Jealous of his own bird?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hee hee."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not laugh."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sorry, you laughed first!"
<p>My giggles just increased his displeasure. He was now glaring at Haguro.
<p>(You can keep being jealous of Haguro all you like, because it's adorable.)
<p>(I hope that more people can discover this fun, adorable side of you.)
<p>(See what you're really like.)
<p>I gazed up at him as we continued to ride--
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Ahhh..."
<p>(Is someone... crying?)
<p>It looked like an old woman. She was on her knees at the edge of the road.
<p>(I wonder what's wrong?)
<p>We slowed as we approached her.
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "My lord? Should I ask her to move?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is fine."
<p>Nobunaga signaled our train to stop.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Woman, why do you cry at the edge of the road like this?"
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "...Mm..?"
<p>The woman seemed to notice us at last.
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "Who... might you be?"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "He is Lord Nobunaga Oda."
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "Ee-eek!"

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "He is Lord Nobunaga Oda."
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "Ee-eek!"
<p>She turned pale and frightened when she heard his name.
<p>(This is still the reception he gets, huh?)
<p>We'd gotten the attention of some other farmers working in the field; they looked at us with the same awe and fright.
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "I-I am so sorry for causing you any displeasure, my lord..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I do not need apologies. Answer my question. Why do you cry?"
<p>(...In fairness, his approach needs work.)
<p>Her eyes swam as she showed hesitance to say anything at all. Finally,
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "Y-you see..."
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "...This land has belonged to us for generations, but the village chief... he's taken it away..."
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "It's all my family's got, and I don't know how we're going to eat now... Oh, my poor little grandchildren..."
<p>(He took the land from her? Just like that?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay, that guy's a jerk and totally doesn't deserve to be in charge."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Understood."
<p>With that one word, Nobunaga gave our horse a little kick and we were off again.
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Shall we do something, my lord?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do what? Give her the rabbit we have hunted?"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Well..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Such meagre charity is not worth the energy."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There is nothing we can do here."
<p>Whispers spread amongst the farmers. I caught a few of them as we passed.
<p><strong>Peasant 1:</strong> "Tch. Guess it's too much to expect the Devil King to care about us humans! Heartless monster!"
<p><strong>Peasant 2:</strong> "Shh! Are you crazy?! Don't say that aloud, he'll kill you!"
<p>("Heartless monster." "He'll kill you.")
<p>It wasn't pleasant what those words did to me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There is no need for you to look that way."
<p>He said that, not having turned to look at me. Then again, it was probably pretty obvious I was seething.

<ul>
    <li><strong>"...There is."</strong></li>
    <li>"It bothers me."</li>
    <li>"They're mean."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I think there is."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You're kind, and I know it, even if no one else does."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am not kind."
<p>(You shouldn't deny it. It's not true...)
<p>......
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Welcome back, my lord."
<p>I felt awful all the way back to the castle. Mitsuhide greeted us at the bridge.
<p>(...Rare for him to welcome us home.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Did something happen?"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "You have a most unusual visitor, my lord."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "A visitor?"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I will escort them in to see you both at the tenshu, if you wish."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "'Both'? Do I know this visitor?"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I suppose you will have to discover that for yourself. Far be it from me to ruin the surprise."
<p>(...What visitor? What surprise?!)
<p>......
<p>???:</strong> "Excuse me."
<p>Nobunaga and I recognized that soft, bell-like voice immediately.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Is that--!"
<p>His expression was stiff, but I was pleased as a peach to see him again.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ranmaru! It IS you!"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...It's been a long time, Lady MC. Lord Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Ranmaru..."

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...It's been a long time, Lady MC. Lord Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Ranmaru..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Have you been well?"
<p>A mix of emotions crossed Ranmaru's face in rapid succession.
<p>The majority of them surprise and sadness.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...Yes, m-my lord. I'm glad to see you in good health as well."
<p>He spoke to the floor; the quivering of his voice audible.
<p>(Oh, Ranmaru. You've probably been dreading this, haven't you?)
<p>He cared for Kennyo and Nobunaga both. Which put him in the unenviable position of being torn between their hatred.
<p>(He hasn't been face-to-face with Nobunaga since the battle with Kennyo either.)
<p>(This is their first time having a real conversation since Honno-ji, at a guess.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Kennyo is not with you?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "He said... he's not ready to come here yet."
<p>(Yeah... Probably gonna be a while before he's able to set foot here.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And why have you come here?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I, um..."
<p>He balled his hands into fists and lifted his gaze up to meet Nobunaga's.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I never got the chance to apologize--"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...For betraying you at Honno-ji, that is. I'm terribly sorry for what I did, my lord."
<p>Ranmaru bowed until his forehead touched the floor.
<p>The light shaking of his soft peach-colored hair betrayed his trembling.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ranmaru--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Apologies are unnecessary."
<p>(Come on, Nobunaga.)
<p>He spoke as coldly as he had this afternoon, and I was a little shocked.
<p>(You can show more kindness than--)
<p>It turned out, I was concerned over nothing.
<p>(...Ah, good. You don't hold it against him.)
<p>It wasn't in his voice. But it was in his eyes.
<p>(What else do you have to say to him?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There is no changing what has passed."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is not my concern if you felt a pang of guilt or the best of intentions."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What you feel has nothing to do with me."
<p>Ranmaru shook.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Y-you're right..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ranmaru, hey, listen."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I know it's hard to hear, but Nobunaga isn't trying to push you away, you know that."
<p>Nobunaga's eyes flashed open.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "It's... okay, Lady MC."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I don't think I deserve forgiveness, so I didn't expect to get it."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "i just wanted to apologize in person... for my own sake."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...I'm sorry for taking up so much of your time. Before I go, let me return this."
<p>Ranmaru set down his short sword on the mat before him and stood up, his tear-stricken face hidden.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ra--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Wait."
<p>Ranmaru stood stock-still at Nobunaga's command.
<p>Nobunaga moved to stand before Ranmaru's sword.
<p>(What is he thinking of doing?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...This was a gift to you. Keep it."
<p>He picked up and thrust the sheathed sword back at him.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "But I'm undeserving--"
<p>Ranmaru didn't move to take it. Nobunaga took a step closer to him.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You were deserving of it when I gave it to you. Your work for me remains invaluable."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I-I can't--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I told you, there is no changing what has passed."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You were a talented spy for Kennyo."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And you were my talented page."
<p>Ranmaru lifted his head.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Both those things remain true."

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You were a talented spy for Kennyo."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And you were my talented page."
<p>Ranmaru lifted his head.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Both those things remain true."
<p>He accepted the short sword with shaking hands.
<p>But as they clutched the handle, his hands shook a little less. He bowed his head.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Will you go now, Ranmaru?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Yes. I've got to get back."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Be well."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...Thank you!"
<p>He smiled fo rthe first time since arriving.
<p>Ranmaru had such a pretty, sweet smile. And I was happy this event hadn't diminished it any.
<p>(Good luck to you and Kennyo, Ranmaru.)
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Lady MC? You take care now!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thanks. May we meet again."
<p>He bowed once more before taking his leave.
<p>(I'm glad Nobunaga and Ranmaru were able to clear things up.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I knew you were nice!"
<p>I turned to Nobunaga once we were alone.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are mistaken."
<p>(Deny it all you wa--)
<p>Huh. I thought he'd have one of those smirks on his face as he said it, but his expression was clouded.
<p>Nobunaga sat at the dais and cast his gaze out at the sky, looking a thousand miles away.
<p>(Hold on a second. Is he--?)
<p>Ranmaru had just left to return to Kennyo. Who knew when we'd see him again?
<p>Was Nobunaga... missing him?
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga...?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What is it?"
<p>Sad or not, I loved him so. I sat down next to him and pulled him into my arms.
<p>Then I began to gently pat his silky, ever so slightly silver-streaked black hair.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "..What are you doing?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Giving you a head pat."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What a nonsensical thing."
<p>He sighed and shook his head.
<p>But he didn't fight me. In fact, his body seemed to relax.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...However, it feels pleasant."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I shall allow you to give me more of these head pats. Now, continue."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Haha! Okay."
<p>I patted his head, loosely running my fingers through his hair.
<p>(I'm so proud of you for trying to process your sadness instead of denying it.)
<p>Even if it made me sad.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC, release me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "If you'd like--oh!"
<p>I'd just freed him when he turned my hug around on me.
<p>With one broad hand capturing the back of my head, he drew me in close--
<p>...and into a passionate, ravenous kiss!
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Don't move."
<p>It was hard not to, my body pressing itself against Nobunaga's to feel more of him.
<p>His hand sneaked under my robes, caressing my growing heat.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mmm, b-but what if--?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What if what?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Oh, I'm just imagining Ranmaru bursting back in here saying he forgot something..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He is too skilled of a page to make that mistake."
<p>(Ah. Meaning he'd hear us, but be discreet about it? I suppose it's fine then.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Is that your only concern?"
<p>I played at thinking about it a little longer. Nobunaga "punished me" by pushing me back and pinning my arms behind my head.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Do you still find me kind?"
<p>Did he really want me to answer that?
<p>(Why do you doubt yourself, Nobunaga?)
<p>(...Is it that you can't forgive yourself?)
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "For the sake of my ambition, I've taken hundreds of thousands of lives. And I will take countless more."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I don't deserve to feel this warmth, or to have these feelings."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "But even knowing that--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I want to hold you. I want to touch you. I can't stop myself."
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Yes?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Kiss me."
<p>I'd do it myself, but he was still pinning me.
<p>Nobunaga relented, giving me a soft kiss.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Again... Keep going..."
<p>The next was longer. More honest...

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Again... Keep going..."
<p>Nobunaga's next kiss was longer. More honest. He moaned a little when I caught his lip before he pulled away.
<p>After that, I didn't need to instruct him further. He let the rain of kisses fall.
<p>When he'd left my lips puffy and hot, he moved on to other parts of my body. Playful nips and prods with his tongue.
<p>(You have to keep going. More, more!)
<p>(Deeper. Until I--!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ahh! God, yes! ...Mmm!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC..."
<p>There it was. That moment when the fire inside us rose to such a fever pitch, it was impossible to tell one from the other.
<p>In that white-hot blaze, it didn't matter who was cold and who was warm. We weren't separate, but one.
<p>I used my thighs, the only part of me he'd left free, and I held him there.
<p>(No matter what anyone else says--)
<p>(...I don't see a devil or a monster in you.)
<p>(I only see someone warm and caring. Someone that I love so much my heart would burst for.)
<p>......
<p>A few days later--
<p>(It's been getting warmer lately.)
<p>I felt the sun beating down hot upon my skin. Riding helped cool the summer heat.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Are you tired?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nope. It may be hot out, but we're just getting started."
<p>Today, we were going on inspection of Owari province, Nobunaga's old home.
<p>(This road is familiar...)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Didn't we pass through here when we were hawking?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Ah! I knew it!"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Please, my lord Nobunaga! Please wait!"
<p>Nobunaga stopped the horse.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What is it?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh! You're that old woman!"
<p>She, assisted by a slightly younger man, was making her way toward us.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is you?"
<p><strong>Son:</strong> "We're so sorry for stopping you, my lord! It's just my mother here, she said she couldn't live without thanking you--"
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "Thank you, my lord... Oh, thank you so much...!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I only did what the matter called for."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There is no need for thanks."
<p>With those words, Nobunaga got our horse trotting along again.
<p><strong>Old Woman:</strong> "Ah, we're undeserving of a lord as humane and kind as you... Why do you still stand?! You bow your head too, boy!"
<p><strong>Son:</strong> "Whoa!"
<p>I offered the two of them a quick return bow before we rode out of sight.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Okay, what did you do?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Nothing of great importance."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hmm..."
<p>I stared at him. He'd done something, and I wasn't going to let the matter drop.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I simply investigated if the woman's claims were true upon our return. They were."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And I discovered their chief guilty of further misdeeds."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I had the old woman's land returned to her-- and I determined her fitting to receive the former chief's land as well."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oooh!"
<p>("Nothing of great importance!" That's a pretty big deal right there!)
<p>(It reminds me of, oh, who's the guy in that story? Ah, I remember now!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You're a regular King Solomon!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Who is that?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, um, another history person. It's complicated. I can explain it to you later."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Perhaps you should."
<p>(Nobunaga will always have his Nobunaga-like ways of doing things, and those methods will be misinterpreted, but--)
<p>I thought of how happy the old woman and her family had looked.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You're always going to be kind."
<p>I waited for the inevitable.
<p>(Hmm?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You didn't say 'I am no such thing!' or 'How foolish to seek kindness in me!' this time."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I simply grew tired of denying it."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "If you say so."
<p>That kind heart once encased so deeply in winter's ice was blooming magnificently.
<p>I hoped other people would see what a beautiful flower it had become.
<p>(Maybe one day, the Traveler's Guide to Japan's Hottest Warlords will have a different nickname for "The Devil King?")
<p>(I can think of a few suggestions...)
<p>With the gentle breeze guiding us along, I shut my eyes and leaned in close to my caring conqueror...
