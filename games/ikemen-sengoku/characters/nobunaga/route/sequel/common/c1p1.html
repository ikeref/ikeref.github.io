  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 1 (1-5)</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...What?!"
<p>The next page of my Traeler's Guide was blank.
<p>I flipped through several more blank pages. Some things, like landmarks, advertisements and profiles, remained.
<p>But a huge swath of pages supposedly telling the history of the period were just... empty.
<p>(What does this mean?)
<p>I felt a chill creep up through me.
<p>Wishing it would go away, I shut the Traveler's Guide.
<p>(Something's going to change history. In a massive way.)
<p>(I've got to tell everyone!)
<p>Pushing through the panic that threatened to overtake me, I began to race toward Azuchi Castle.
<p>It was mostly empty of people. I took the opportunity to assess the damage.
<p>The castle's inner palace is holding up, unlike the tenshu.
<p>Outside of the burnt wreckage looming over the building, you almost couldn't tell it had been under attack.
<p>(I'm worried. I heard everyone survived...)
<p>(...But where was Nobunaga when the tenshu was attacked?)
<p>(Was he hurt? Is it bad? Is he...?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Take it easy, MC..."
<p>But my voice quaked as visions of Nobunaga, injured, plagued my mind.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "MC!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Is that--?"
<p>Just as I'd begun to run, I heard someone call my name.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You're back!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hideyoshi! And--?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Hey there, Princess! I've heard the rumors about you."
<p>(...Weird, as I don't know anything about you. Except that you dress like a theater actor who thinks he's still on stage.)
<p>Couldn't fault the man, though, as the colorful clothes suited him. Very well.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hi there. Yes, I'm MC. It's nice to meet you. Um--?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Keiji Maeda's my name, though I answer to 'that eccentric guy over there!' and 'Hey, you!' You can take your pick!"
<p>He had big, shining eyes like a cat's and a smile like a bright sunny day.
<p>Fear and worry still clouded my mind, but I couldn't help but smile with him.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay, eccentric guy."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You've already got the hang of it!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...You forgot to include 'problem child' in your list of names."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "MC, hard as it is to believe, Keiji's also an Oda vassal-state warlord."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "He had the gall to LEAVE without saying anything, but he did return with information about the attack."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We had just enough time to inform Ieyasu and Masamune too. They're back as well. Everyone's back."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Where's Nobunaga though?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "In war council. You look like you'd like the chance to see him for yourself."
<p>I followed Hideyoshi and Keiji into the audience chamber where I saw the familiar faces of the Oda warlords.
<p>(Nobunaga!)
<p>But my eyes went straight to the man I loved, sitting atop the dais. The weight in my heart lifted to see him.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, welcome back."

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, welcome back."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Thanks. I'm glad to be back!"
<p>I probably shouldn't have sounded so happy under the circumstances, or smiled so much, but I couldn't help it.
<p>(Good. He doesn't look injured.)
<p>(...Maybe I should check though? No, no! Down, girl! It's war council time!)
<p>Restraining the desire [to] embrace him, I forced myself down in my seat at the back of the room.
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Here I thought we were going to see you leap into his arms, lass."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "If it helps, you maybe pretend the rest of us aren't here."
<ul>
  <li><strong>"Not now."</strong></li>
  <li>"Gee, thanks, Mitsuhide."</li>
  <li>"I don't need to pretend."</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ahem! For your information, I still wouldn't because it's war council time."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "How admirable."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you are able to restrain yourself after several days without me, I shall have to try harder to break that resistance."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah, I-- What? ...Is that a threat or a promise, Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will let you decide which when I am done making love to you."
<p>Ooh, the way he could turn my insides to lava with one teasing [look] from his deep carnelian eyes.
<p>(Maybe I shouldn't have restrained myself in front of everyone after all?)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Now that MC's punishment has been settled upon, let us return to business."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "May I continue my report, my lord?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You may."
<p>The joviality of the room fell away at the sound of that voice.
<p>Even I modeled myself after the stern faces around me.
<p>(I'd like to be caught up on our situation as quickly as possible.)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "News of the attack has spread throughout the region, just days after the destruction of the tenshu."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I would say there is no one across these islands who does not know."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Which is why, as expected, we have seen a rash of insurrections brewing."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Our unification shaken because Nobunaga bled just one drop...?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "It was a big drop. Azuchi Castle was a symbol of Lord Nobunaga's authority, and now there's a huge hole through it."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I'm certain the rumors have him already on his last legs."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "If his domain is going to go to pieces, then everyone's going to scramble to add bits of it to their own."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "It was to be expected. What was not is the large number of previously loyal vassals who have turned on us..."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Our spies indicate there is a third party riling them up."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Someone's convinced them they can become the next Nobunaga if they're quick enough, huh?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "This isn't a laughing matter, Masamune."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Especially if that third party ends up being Kicho."
<p>(Kicho?)
<p>I didn't recognize the name.
<p>(But they sound like they're on a roll, so I'll ask about this Kicho later.)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We don't know that for sure."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Keiji's investigation puts Kicho as being behind the artillery attack..."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...But it's difficult to move when we don't have hard evidence against him."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "He's been holed up in his merchant house the entire time."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "It'd be a different story if we captured weapons, men, evidence... anything from that night."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Not to mention our mastermind has made no further attempt on our lord's life, nor his territory."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Their motive remains a mystery."
<p>(So, it's likely this Kicho is behind the strike, but we can't pin it on him yet.)
<p>(If it is him, we don't know why he did it nor what he plans to do next.)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Unless instability was their goal and they have already achieved exactly what they wanted."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Regardless, we have two issues here."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Putting down the insurrections, and uncovering the aims of the mastermind behind the attack on the tenshu."

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Regardless, we have two issues here."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Putting down the insurrections, and uncovering the aims of the mastermind behind the attack on the tenshu."
<p>A thoughtful silence fell over the hall.
<p>I had a feeling it was bad, but we're actually in desperate straits here.
<p>We'd had an insurrection after the Honno-ji incident and my arrival, but this was far more serious.
<p>Not that any insurrection was easy. I recalled Yoshitoshi, who'd tried to poison us and been slaughtered in turn.
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There's a difference between those who've recently joined you, and those who have served you for generations."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If someone that close to you stabs you in the back, they will never return to your side."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You have to lance a festering wound."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Or else disease will eat away at you from within."
<p>......
<p>(I thought those executions were too brutal, and came too swiftly. But I know why he did it...)
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The first time I killed a man, I was thirteen years old."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He was an assassin sent by my brother."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It's kill or be killed. You only have one choice if you want to live. Thus, there's no reason to hesitate."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That's when I swore to gain enough power to put a stop to all the fighting."
<p>......
<p>(Once more, he'll be forced to kill those who once served him. Without mercy.)
<p>I hated the thought of Nobunaga freezing his heart once more to deal with the weight of his sin.
<p>I wished the pain in my own heart could somehow lessen his.
<p>(Though I musn't forget that my being here with him is helping him.)
<p>(I'm here to provide him warmth and help him hold onto his humanity.)
<p>(Remind him of when it's safe.)
<p>(...Nothing can take me from your side, Nobunaga. Nothing.)
<p>A calm, majestic voice broke the storm of silence dominating the hall.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I expect not a one of you here..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...is even considering that something as trivial as this will put an end to my campaign of unification."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We are all ready, my lord, to continue carving your path forward."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Those who stand in your way will rue their choice, though not for long."
<p>There wasn't a look of doubt among them.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "After all, you've got me back!"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...For how long? I hope you know that there's no point in bragging if you just wander off again."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Don't get mired in the past!"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "He's right, Ieyasu. You know you're happy to see him again."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "No, I'm not. See this? Does this look like a happy expression?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I must say, Lord Keiji's return has made everything that much more lively."
<p>It hadn't taken long for the warlords to break into their usual banter. It was calming.
<p>(They recover so fast! I guess that's part and parcel of being famous historical--)
<p>(...Right! The guide book!)

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>(They recover so fast! I guess that's part and parcel of being famous historical--)
<p>(...Right! The guide book!)
<p>That reminded me of my nearly blank copy of "A Traveler's Guide to Japan's Hottest Warlords."
<p>(It's possible the current destabilization has something to do with the disappearing history.)
<p>(That said, hardly any of them know about the magazine.)
<p>(I'd like another opinion on it, but I think it's going to confuse them more than bring light to the situation.)
<p>While I was deciding what to do, council reached its conclusion, and Nobunaga dismissed the others.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hideyoshi, Mitsunari, you are to stay."
<p><strong>Both:</strong> "Yes, lord."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
<p><strong>Hime:</strong> "Yes?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Wait for me in my room in the inner palace."
<p>My heart trembled at the hint of sweetness in his voice.
<p>MC:</strong> "...I will."
<p>(Maybe I'll tell him about the guidebook there in private.)
<p>It was Mitsuhide who caught me outside the audience hall and showed me to Nobunaga's new quarters.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Minus the large, unintended skylight, the castle hasn't changed much."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Not on the surface. There are ripples everywhere, but everyone has faced worse, one way or another."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm glad that we still have a home. Huh. What's going on there?"
<p>In the garden, several soldiers seemed to be engaging Keiji in some practice.
<p><strong>Soldier:</strong> "I'm not done yet!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Yeah, that's the spirit! That stroke right there? You're getting better!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Better, but not best!"
<p><strong>Soldier:</strong> "Whoa!?"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "Haha! He knocked you on your ass!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Who's laughter do I hear? Sounds like someone wants to volunteer!"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "Ugh! W-wait! I didn't--ack!"
<p><strong>Soldier 3:</strong> "You can't say you didn't deserve that!"
<p><strong>Soldier 4:</strong> "Good one, Lord Keiji!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Huh. They make getting the stuffing knocked out of you look fun."
<p>I couldn't help but smile to see a little joie de vie back in the faces of Azuchi Castle's residents.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Keiji Maeda lacks for neither military skill nor charm."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "You won't find a single Oda soldier who doesn't respect him, if not adore him outright."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It looks like it."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "The only question is why does he have such adoration for us?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Is there a reason he wouldn't?"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "There are many who hate Lord Nobunaga simply because they have heard of his villainous deeds."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Others have a more personal reason. And they are most pesky, as a result."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Some lost their station, some their families, some those they love..."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Keiji's adopted father was evicted from his own land by Lord Nobunaga's own father, leaving them homeless."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh..."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Keiji worked his way back up, serving various lords until becoming a retainer of his uncle--an Oda vassal."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "A tale like this would normally end in revenge against the son of the man who took everything from him, however..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Keiji doesn't seem interested in getting revenge, right?"
<p>Still, it astonished me how carefree Keiji looked now, given all the struggles of his childhood.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Certainly not against Lord Nobunaga. That much, I can assure you."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Speaking of, you'll find our lord's room just past here. Enjoy yourself."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "A-ahem. Thank you."
<p>I bowed to Mitsuhide as he left, but I didn't move; his words stuck with me.
<p>(A personal reason...)
<p>(I wonder if whoever is behind this attack feels that Nobunaga took something important from them?)
<p>(But even if you give back what was taken, you can't undo the original loss. How do you erase that hate?)
<p>Just as I found myself sinking into depressive thoughts...
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey, Princess."

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey, Princess. Not heading straight for Lord Nobunaga's room?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, Keiji..."
<p>There was a fun-loving joy to his voice that suited his bright smile.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Judging by the look on your face, someone gave you the long and short on my story."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I, err, yes?"
<p>(I wasn't looking. Was he watching Mitsuhide and I talking?!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm sorry. I hope I haven't made things awkward..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Awkward's always welcome here. And besides, Lord Nobunaga's princess has a right to know my story."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Especially if I might be putting your lord in danger. Right...?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm not worried about that!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...But I am curious about how you came around on him and the Oda."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "We're standing on the cusp of history. Being mad about your misfortunes isn't just shortsighted, it doesn't help."
<p>It's like he spoke to my earlier worries.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I didn't like how mopey things got in my family. I decided to lighten things up, by myself, if I had to."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Turns out, smiles are infectious."
<p>(Smiles are infectious, huh?)
<p>Silly as it sounded, it made sense.
<p>And it spoke to the truth of the man behind the flashy dress and big smiles.
<p>(I get it.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You pay a lot of attention to what's going on around you."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hmm?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Well, you stopped what you were doing to come talk to me, right as I was feeling down."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That wasn't a coincidence, I'm guessing."
<p>(He probably didn't hear us, what with his training. Meaning he picked up all that just by observing me.)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Heck, I'd question the sense of a guy who couldn't see how you were feeling."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I'll be around if you need some cheering up, though."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "See ya!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Oof! Haha!"
<p>Keiji gave me a strong pat on the back.
<p>I recovered in time to see him wave as he returned to his garden sparring.
<p>(Smiles are infectious. Smiles are infectious...)
<p>(I should remember that advice for when I'm with Nobunaga.)
<p>I hurried to his new room.
<p>......
<p>Keiji glanced back at MC out of the corner of his eye.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You're the observant one."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...She's an unusual woman."
<p>......
<p>(It shouldn't be long until Nobunaga gets here himself.)
<p>I was so impatient I could barely focus on Nobunaga's new room. Though I did spy something that made me happy.
<p>(Aww! He's already got Bearsace up!)
<p>Next to all the lavish artwork and items of splendor was a fluffy bear with big eyes and an even bigger heart.
<p>I smiled to see he was safe, when--
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Have I kept you waiting?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Not at all!"
