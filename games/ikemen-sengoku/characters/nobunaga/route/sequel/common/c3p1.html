  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 3 (1-5)</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>???:</strong> "I thought it might be you."
<p>(But who are you? And why do you know about popcorn?)
<p>(Could he be another time traveler?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You know me?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "In investigating the people close to Nobunaga, I learned of a woman known for making unusual statements."
<p>("Investigating the people close to Nobunaga" means there's a pretty high chance you're a non-friendly.)
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Have you been unwell lately?"
<p>(What... is he asking?)
<p>My breath caught in my throat.
<p>Fear had a tight grip on me, and I found myself freezing up.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...How did you know that?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "So, you have."
<p>A smile, chilling for its beauty, alighted on the man's face.
<p>It was one of the coldest, darkest smiles I'd ever seen.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "It was worth coming out here to check on you."
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Now I know everything is working out."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You really need to start explaining yourself."
<p>(Like how you knew I was sick.)
<p><strong>???:</strong> "I had a theory that as I progressed in my plan, it would have an effect on those who came from the future."
<p>("The future!")
<p>The more he spoke, the more questions I had. And I definitely didn't like how he looked at me with a kind of pity.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "It must be frightening to feel death inching closer to you without knowing how or why, so I will tell you."
<p><strong>???:</strong> "I am going to put a stop to Japan's unification and keep the country at war."
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Thus, the future you were born in will cease to exist."
<p>MC:</strong> "...What?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "You'll die alongside your miserable world."
<p><strong>???:</strong> "If it helps, it's not personal. Your life is a necessary sacrifice."
<p><strong>???:</strong> "I hope this knowledge can help you treasure what time you have left."
<p>He walked away, his business here done.
<p><strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> "Sorry for the wait, Lady MC! Here's your sugar candy--hmm?"
<p><strong>Shopkeeper:</strong> "Did that other customer leave?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Y-yeah..."
<p>I could do little but replay his dangerous words in my mind.
<p>(My future... will cease to exist...?)
<p>(...And I'll die with it...?)
<p>(I- I have to let Nobunaga know!)
<p>As quick as I could, I returned to the castle.
<p>......
<p>I saw him as soon as I'd crossed the gates. He was giving orders to the troops.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC?"
<p>Nobunaga came to meet me immediately. He put his arms around me tight.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What is wrong?"
<p>I explained as calmly as I could.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...He said he plans to disrupt my unification and change the future?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And he implied doing that would... kill me."
<p>I imagined my life being erased piece by piece, like the pages of the guide book.
<p>(If the headaches and my passing out are more proof of the future changing--)
<p>(...It all works out. Except that this is ridiculous! I've seen it happen and I still can't--or don't want to believe it!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What did he look like?"

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That man. What did he look like?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...About Mitsunari's height, with short, silky dark hair and eyes like pale topaz. He was dressed mostly in white..."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga? What is the matter?"
<p>The others were there too. They came over once they noticed something was wrong.
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Is MC sick again?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "She doesn't look well. You all right, lass?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Kicho is in Azuchi."
<p>The news shook the room.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wait..."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We're sure?"
<p>(Then, the man I met was--?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That was Kicho?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I have three reasons to suspect so."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "First, he stated he would stop my unification. That would tie him to the group who destroyed the tenshu."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Second, he was able to learn about those closest to me without suspicion. Someone close in the past could do so."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Third is that his features match your description of him."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will learn for certain when I see him. Bring my horse. We will capture him before he can return to Sakai."
<p><strong>Vassal:</strong> "Yes, my lord."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hideyoshi, continue the preparations for our journey, just in case."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I understand."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, as the only witness, you are coming with me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Of course I will."
<p>Nobunaga mounted the horse his vassal returned with, helping me up as well.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Ieyasu, Masamune, take your most trusted and come with me."
<p><strong>Ieyasu and Masamune:</strong> "My lord."
<p>......
<p>(Okay, so, say that guy is Kicho...)
<p>(Why come to Azuchi when he's on our most wanted list for destroying the tenshu and fanning the revolts?)
<p>(...He really went through all that danger to see me?)
<p>I had a vague death sentence looming above me, but I was more concerned about these lingering quetsions.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are wondering why he has appeared in Azuchi, aren't you?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wha?!"
<p>(Nobunaga sure saw through me quick that time. I think that's a record.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Yes. I guess he wanted to see me, but why would he risk such danger?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I imagine he felt he no longer had a need to hide."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Why?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Because the next step of his plan is already in progress, no doubt."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "One that cannot be stopped by attempting to capture him."
<p>Nobunaga kept his eyes ahead as he drove his horse forward.
<p>But I saw what motivated him. Cold, calculating logic and burning, murderous hatred.
<p>(Even so, we have to stop Kicho. Somehow.)
<p>There was too much at stake.
<p>(I believe Nobunaga can find a way.)
<p>(...I don't like what he may end up having to do to himself to stop Kicho's plans though.)
<p>Nobunaga noticed I was staring. He shared a slight smile with me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not worry. He will not have his way."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Mmm."
<p>I returned with a smile of my own. His eyes were back on the road now.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You have an idea where he went?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He will have departed Azuchi as soon as he finished talking with you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Though he could hide out and attempt to stall for time, a former Oda ally would know we would catch him eventually."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Thus, he will avoid the fuss and take the most direct path back to Sakai."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We will catch up to him at the Seta-no-Karahashi bridge."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "There."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ah!"
<p>We found him watching the waters of the Seta river, his horse resting on the bridge.
<p>I got the distinct feeling we hadn't caught up to him as much as he was waiting for us to arrive.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "You finally found me."

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>???:</strong> "You finally found me."
<p>He mounted back up and quietly loaded several bullets into his gun.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That is the man you saw, MC?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes, that's him."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...It has been a long time, Kicho."
<p>Nobunaga, keeping off the bridge, spoke to him from the safety of the riverside.
<p>Kicho gave him a bored look.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Did you come all this way to force an apology from me for leaving without saying goodbye?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Such words would be meaningless. Why were you waiting for me here?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "A war will start soon. A large one. I thought I might try and persuade you to see my point of view before it starts."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You, persuade me? ...Tell me what you are thinking."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "War is a necessary evil. In order to keep it going, I require the Oda forces to suffer a tremendous loss."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...But I would not like you to be among the casualties, if possible."
<p>(He requires Nobunaga for his scheme?)
<p>I didn't understand what that scheme was. To me, he seemed to be contradicting himself.
<p>Nobunaga, too, seemed to be quietly searching Kicho's face for signs of a clearer motive.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You've constructed a war to kill me, yet you want me to live?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "That's right."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Your survival at Honno-ji was nothing short of a miracle."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I fully believe you are the key to destroying the future."
<p>(Whoa, whoa, whoa! Pretty or not, Kicho's just gone full omnicidal maniac here!)
<p>That was MY future he was talking about! THe lives of everyone living there and everyone who'd created it.
<p>Fury rose inside me; Nobunaga signaled to me, and somehow, I held myself back.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Go on. Finish your explanation."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You are an endless font of hatred and ill will, Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "For all that you attempt to achieve unification through violence, the crimes you carry will beget more violence."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Because you are the spark that keeps the flames of war burning."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "As long as you are alive, the world you are seeking will never come to pass."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Thus, in punishment for your crimes, you will spend your life doing just that."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You will live and keep this country engulfed in war."

<ul>
    <li><strong>(I don't like that!)</strong></li>
    <li>"What do you know?!"</li>
    <li>"That's awful!"</li>
</ul>

<p>(That's it! I don't like a single thing this creep says or thinks!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga is not the cause of all the wars!"
<p>I shouted with all my might.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Do you even know how much he's sacrificed to get us this close to--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga is closer than anyone to bringing peace to this time!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And if YOU didn't get in the way, he--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, calm yourself."
<p>Nobunaga's measured, even tone made that possible. Barely.
<p>But my whole body was trembling.
<p>(I just...! Argh! I'm so mad to see someone talk about you this way!)
<p>Kicho cast a bored glance my way.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "It doesn't matter what he's striving for."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You know yourself he was supposed to die at Honno-ji. It's written in all this country's textbooks."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ah!"
<p>(History textbooks...!)
<p>(You DO know about the future!)
<p>Nobunaga didn't seem to react to Kicho's revelation.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "All I want is to remove the possibility that the world of the future I beheld comes to pass."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "As someone who lived in that future, why? What makes it so worthy of erasure?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I don't need to answer someone who's already heavily biased against me."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I'll dedicate my life to keeping this country from achieving unification. Nobunaga's victims will make that easy."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Speaking of victims, the woman you love will die, but she was doomed the moment she was born in that future."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Meanwhile, you will continue to struggle for peace until your dying day."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "And your battle with me will tear this land asunder, until its future is remade anew--"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Into a better one."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And if I kill you now before any of this comes to pass?"

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And if I kill you now before any of this comes to pass?"
<p>Nobunaga withdrew his matchlock pistol.
<p>He lifted it toward Kicho; Kicho raised his own pistol toward Nobunaga.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You never change, Nobunaga. In answer to your question: it's easy."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I simply make sure you never get this close to me again."
<p>Then Kicho lowered his gun, pointing it at the foot of the bridge.
<p>(Where is he aiming?)
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You'll have lpenty others to fight directly. Meanwhile, with your permission, 'my lord', I'll be departing."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC! Get back!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Uh oh!"
<p>...
<p>(M-my ears...)
<p>A thunderous noise soundd and a cloud of smoke and ash rose.
<p>(That was... an explosion...)
<p>Nobunaga held me tight, yet I still felt pelted by bits of debris and sand. Once it seemed safe, I opened my eyes--
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh god!"
<p>(There's a huge chunk missing from the bridge...)
<p>Right at the spot Kicho had aimed.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You had explosives planted before our arrival."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You couldn't have done this on your own, however. Nor can I ever imagine you daring to fight me alone."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Don't sound so surprised. You're the one who taught me how to make good use of pawns."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "That's all the time I've got for you, I'm afraid. I hope you won't disappoint me next time, Nobunaga."
<p>With a haunting smile, he wheeled his white horse around to leave.
<p>...Firing a last parting shot.
<p>It hit the midsection of the bridge and caused a second explosion.
<p>(Another bomb?!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga...! The bridge! It's--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes, I can see."
<p>Fire engulfed the crumbling wooden structure.
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Nobunaga! Are you all right?!"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "...What the...?"
<p>Masamune and Ieyasu arrived with their men. Just in time to see the chaos.
<p>The wooden bridge buckled and moaned as the fire tore at it, hollowing out its supports until it collapsed under its own weight.
<p>(Chances this bridge was our one and only accessible route to Sakai? High.)
<p>Not only couldn't we chase him, we weren't able to do ANYTHING to him.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It was indeed Kicho that MC met."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He was the lone mastermind behind the proliferation of weapons and the resulting revolts."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Was destroying the bridge his hat trick?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "That was a nice piece of architecture he wrecked."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We know his goals now. We must return to Azuchi and prepare for war."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...War? What, with Sakai? Because wasn't that where we were planning on going?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It was. Now then--"
<p>I only vaguely listened as Nobunaga spoke with Ieyasu and Masamune.
<p>Kicho's words consumed my thoughts.
<p>(Peace can never come as long as Nobunaga is alive?)
<p>(...I refuse to believe that.)
<p>(Nobunaga will one day bring about peace. I know he will...)
<p>I... also knew he had many enemies.
<p>Enemies in the form of friends and former allies. Trusted [ones].
<p>(Nobunaga once told me that if war broke out even after unification, he would continue to fight to protect it.)
<p>(But what if the fighting never stopped?)
<p>It hurt to imagine.
<p>It hurt to imagine Nobunaga fighting until there was nothing left of him.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
<p>I lifted my head to look at him.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If we take what Kicho told us, as long as I can kill him and achieve my goal--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...your future will arrive as it should, and you will continue to live."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Nothing has changed."
<p>Nobunaga spoke with unshakeable will.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Or do you think I am the kind of man to lose to Kicho's controlling whims?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "There's no question of that..."
<p>(Why am I wavering when I already promised myself I'd support him?)
<p>(I can't believe I was taking the stuff Kicho said so seriously. Come on, me!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...You'll definitely do it."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Good."
<p>He smiled with satisfaction, taking me into his warm arms.
<p>(Nobunaga, you are amazing.)
<p>(I know that whatever Kicho is planning, as long as we're together, we can stop him.)
<p>(In fact, just having you hold me fills me with courage.)
<p>I buried my face in his chest, feeling calmer even as I did.
<p>(I wanted to be his rock, but he's been the one keeping me together.)
<p>(I should figure out a way to keep his confidence levels high in the meantime.)
<p>(Kicho might think I'm not long for this world, but I've got way too much to do before I die!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga's Voice:</strong> "...For the moment, you should be your own primary concern."
<p><strong>Nobunaga's Voice:</strong> "...I will not have you disappear on me before I complete my unification..."
<p>His arms tightened around me suddenly.
<p>(Nobunaga?)
<p>Was he shaking? Was his voice... quaking?
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...What?"
<p>(I just--)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You sound a little... afraid."
<p>(It reminded me of the way he talked when I was still sick.)
<p>(A little different though...)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Are you taunting me?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wha? No! No, I wasn't!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "How very bold. And very foolish. You do know what this means, right?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "B-but Nobunaga! There's people here... and the bridge is on fire, which is probably more important."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We have too few with us to put it out in time. Thus, I deem us free to do as we like while it burns."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you truly wish me to be less free with your body, you should not give up your games of Go so easily."
<p>His delightful smile as he teased me reminded me of the old Nobunaga.
<p>Perhaps I shouldn't have been so complacent about that. Perhaps I should have noticed the little oddities.
<p>...And how dangerous they might become.
