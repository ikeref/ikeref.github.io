  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 6 (1-5)</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "The Uesugi and Takeda will lend our strength to the Oda in this battle."
<p>Kanetsugu withdrew his sword, a signal for the riflemen to step back and the cavalry in wait behind them to take the lead.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "WELL?! Don't just wait fer Kenshin to get here! Kill 'em!"
<p><strong>Crew:</strong> "Uh, yeah!"
<p>The soldiers who'd begun to falter charged once more.
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "We will present the commander's head to our lord as a gift. Onward!"
<p><strong>Subordinate:</strong> "Yes, sir!"
<p>Keiji's voice carried over the three forces.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "If you planned on helping us out, you coulda put that in your letter!"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "It was my lord's decision to make! I don't move according to your schedule!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "But you do move according to his?! Well, don't let me slow you--or him, down!"
<p>Kanetsugu's eyes had a deadly glint.
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "If you're going to insult Lord Kenshin, I'll strike you down here and now!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Kind of a mean thing to do to your new ally, don'cha think?"
<p><strong>Soldier:</strong> "Lord Motonari!"
<p>It was one of the Mouri's standard toops who arrived to interrupt the fray.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "What! I don't see our guns anywhere! I told you to bring more gunners!"
<p><strong>Soldier:</strong> "There's a problem with that! The guns... they're not working!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Whaddya mean?!"
<p><strong>Soldier:</strong> "We captured the person responsible; he seems to be one of [Mitsuhide Akechi]'s soldiers!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "That damn silver kitsune... He and his men can sneak into anywhere. What's the damage like?"
<p><strong>Soldier:</strong> "The guns won't fire. But the biggest problem is the gunpowder... There's nothing left of it...
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Ooh, gonna be hard to win without your shiny new weapons, huh?!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "...Damn it all to hell."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Your side had men infiltrating the enemy?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey, it was all Mitsunari's idea! If you want to stop the enemy's weapons, you've got to understand them first."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Mitsunari Ishida, yes? It seems the Oda have a somewhat competent strategist."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You might like him. Most everyone does. Which makes him the opposite of you!"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "...You're lucky you're so likeable yourself."
<p>......
<p>The Uesugi-Takeda switching sides affected all battlefronts, not just Keiji's.
<p>Enemy Soldier:</strong> "S-stay back! No!"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "There's only one kind of mercy in battle."
<p>The God of War's blade fell with a flash.
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "...A swift death."
<p>Indeed, the man expired without a sound. Shingen looked at Kenshin and laughed.
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "That's Kenshin for you. Quick to turn his sword on his enemies--and his most loyal men, if they displease him."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "...I would have, if I thought Kanetsugu spoke out of a desire to save himself by siding with the stronger force."
<p>......
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Then what? Give up on kliling Nobunaga and hunt down the arms merchants instead?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "I would suggest--"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "...We side with the Oda in this battle."
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "What?! With the Devil King?!"

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p>As Yukimura shouted, shingen raised a hand, quieting his vassal's objections.
<p>This matter was between Kenshin and Kanetsugu now.
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "You've been swayed by another man and become an Oda patsy, have you?"
<p>Kenshin had already withdrawn his trusted sword, Himezuru Ichimonji.
<p>Its sharp edge lay against the flesh of Kanetsugu's neck.
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Keiji Maeda, is that his name? The man you infiltrated Sakai with?"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Did you think I wouldn't find out?"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Exchanging secret missives under my nose is already worthy of death. Now you suggest allying with our enemies?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "My loyalty to you has never wavered."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "If, after hearing my counsel, you still desire to have my head, then I would just as soon gift it to you, my lord."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "But we cannot trust Kicho."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "The moment he has dealt with Nobunaga, he will make an enemy of all of us."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "I will not take back what I said."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "This is to protect you and Echigo."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Either kill me or side with the Oda."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Your decision, my lord?"
<p>......
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "He's grown."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "It was worth the effort to build up his mind and his skills."
<p>Kenshin looked pleased; Shingen only sighed.
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "...I don't think you had anything to do with that one. He worships the ground you walk on. Soon he'll be dressing like you."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Enough useless chatter, Shingen. We will take the head of the man who dared to think he could use us."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...The Uesugi and Takeda have come to our side, you say?"
<p>Nobunaga's smile was full of confidence.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I would have expected they had an eye for how the battle was turning."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Currently, we have the superior numbers. A portion of the enemy forces are already beginning to retreat."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The cowards. I see no sense in letting those who obstruct my conquest go."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I shall depart for the front. Mitsunari, dispatch the following orders."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "My lord...?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Kicho will most definitely do something to sabotage our victory following the battle."
<p>Mitsunari's eyes widened.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "In order for the Oda to truly win, this battle must lead to a successful unification."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The real fight begins the moment the battle is over. See that everyone is aware of this."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Yes, my lord."
<p>......
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You will not escape!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ah--!"
<p>As Sasuke reached to pull me up onto the horse, Kennyo pulled me from his grip.
<p>He grabbed my arm, firmly.
<p>(I think he's right about that...!)
<p>With his other hand, he shook his blade free from his staff and brought it dangerously close to my face--
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Let me go...!"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...Kennyo! Wait!"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "We won't stop you, and we won't try to run again. Just please, spare us..."
<p>Sasuke dismounted and fell prostrate in front of Kennyo.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sasuke..."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "My apologies, MC. But... we can't do anything if either of us die here."
<p>(Sasuke's right. Our lives are too high a cost if all it's going to do is slow Kennyo down.)
<p>I'd stopped fighting too.
<p>Kennyo looked down at me. Slowly, he reached for the other end of his staff.
<p>Just as he began to sheathe it--
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "What?!"
<p>(Yeah, what?!)
<p>There was a boom; his weapon shattered in his hand, which he pulled back quickly.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I'm rather impressed by the notable increase in firepower this musket can... muster."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mitsuhide?!"

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I'm rather impressed by the notable increase in firepower this musket can... muster."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mitsuhide?!"
<p>Mitsuhide and several men emerged from the forest.
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Now, MC!"
<p>I recovered from my shock.
<p>Kennyo's grip on me had loosened, and I broke away from him.
<p>Sasuke and I scrambled over toward the relative safety of Mitsuhide and his men.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I thought I had gotten rid of all your spies... it seems some slipped through."
<p>Mitsuhide shrugged in response to Kennyo's bitter calm.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Oh, don't doubt yourself. You did fine work in digging out and executing my subordinates."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "What you failed to realize was that you had a conspirator on your own side."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "There's no--!"
<p>(He means Ranmaru.)
<p>(And speaking of!)
<p>Ranmaru, who had remained hidden amongst Mitsuhide's troops, stepped out just then. He looked pale and shaken.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...Ranmaru..."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "His information made it easy to track you."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Which allowed me to bow out on the current battle so that I could capture you before you reached it yourself."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Though it was my lord's orders that Ranmaru should accompany me."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Lord Mitsuhide, this wasn't the agreement!"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "You shot at him! You weren't supposed to do anything until I got to speak to him!"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "My dearest apologies. Not for saving MC's life, you understand."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master Kennyo, I..."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...No. This is my fault. There's nothing you need to say."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I have done wrong in leading you onto this path, and now, I am forced to kill you."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...If you have to... But listen to me first."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "What is there to hear? The reason you chose Nobunaga over me? I will not--"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Will you just LISTEN to me?!"
<p>(...Oh, man. Ranmaru...)
<p>I'd never seen Ranmaru raise his voice that way against Kennyo.
<p>There was anguish and sadness in his voice. But most of all, he sounded mad.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "You think we're on different paths! That this can only end in death for one of us or both... But we're not and we never were!"
<p>Chastised, Kennyo held his tongue.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "You led me here, don't you remember?"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "How did I do so?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Because you knew you couldn't kill Lord Nobunaga if it would make me sad. That's the real reason you left me behind."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "What... what foolishness..."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Revenge has taken over your heart, but it hasn't consumed all of it. The part of you that wants peace and reconciliation--"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "It's that part that brought me here! I know it is!"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...You only wish it were that way. But I have long ago thrown away my heart."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "It's not something you can throw away!"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "The man who saved me as a child is still there inside you! I'll prove it to you!"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "No matter... how long as it takes--...!"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Please... please, just don't ever tell me... you're going to go off to die... alone...!"
<p>Tears streamed from Ranmaru's eyes.
<p>Kennyo's stiff and stern expression appeared to crack...

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>Tears streamed from Ranmaru's eyes.
<p>Kennyo's stiff and stern expression appeared to crack...
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga has declared that if you swear you will disrupt his attempts at unification no further--"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "...Then he will overlook what happened at Honno-ji."
<p>(Nobunaga, thank you.)
<p>I didn't know until now that he'd set this up with Mitsuhide, Ranmaru, and Kennyo, but somehow, I wasn't surprised.
<p>(I'm sure you've got a convenient "It benefitted me" explanation for why you did this... but thank you anyway.)
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master Kennyo... please..."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...This time, I want you to walk with me on my path."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "To think the day would come when you would offer me guidance."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "If the many souls we lost at Hongan-ji saw me now, they would be furious at me."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...'How could you make Ranmaru cry?' I can hear them say."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master..."
<p><strong>Brethren:</strong> "Abbot Kennyo..."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "But still, it is unforgiveable--"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...It is unforgiveable that I be allowed to stop here after what I have made all of you do; what I have put you through till now."
<p><strong>Brethren:</strong> "Pardon us, but you haven't made us do anything. We're not your vassals, Abbot. We're your brethren--your family."
<p><strong>Brethren:</strong> "Some of us [may] not be able to forget or forgive what happened, it's true."
<p><strong>Brethren:</strong> "But not a one of us would stop you or stand in the way of you finding your path."
<p>The younger brethren who'd been speaking now led the others in a chorus of agreement.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I am... so sorry..."
<p>Kennyo fell to his knees, his apology reaching all of us. Including, perhaps, those who only watched from beyond.
<p>Ranmaru hugged Kennyo gently while his other brethren watched over them both.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "If it is love that gives birth to hate, then it may be that love is also the cure."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Kennyo should be thankful so many wanted him to live, even as he tried to give his soul up to the demon."
<p>(Love can cure hate?)
<p>Those words resounded in my mind.
<p>Kennyo had spoken of hate too, hadn't he?
<p>......
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...What do you know...?"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You cannot possibly have experienced the kind of hatred that burns your soul every waking moment of your life."
<p>......
<p>I realized I'd gotten so angry then because it was a question I'd been pondering over for some time now.
<p>(I don't know what Nobunaga's enemies feel for him; what it's like to have so much taken from you.)
<p>After all, it was my choice to stand beside him. To support him every moment I could.
<p>That meant being prepared to face those who hated him with every fiber of their being.
<p>(But maybe you don't need to know hate to reach people--as long as you know love?)
<p>Right now, I wasn't sure what I felt. Powerless, for one thing. Left behind...
<p>Afraid. Afraid I might never see Nobunaga again. That I might never love again...
<p>That feeling took hold of me once more.
<p>(That's why I don't want to be anywhere else than by your side, Nobunaga.)

<ul>
    <li>(That won't change.)</li>
    <li><strong>(Don't give up.)</strong></li>
    <li>(Don't disappear.)</li>
</ul>

<p>(I don't want you to give up your life just because you fear you can't protect me.)
<p>(Whatever foolish thing you decide to do... don't make it leaving me alone.)
<p>Kennyo agreed to be bound pending further discussion on his case with Nobunaga. Ranmaru never once left his side.
<p>Sasuke and I joined up with Mitsuhide's troop as all of us went to meet with Nobunaga on the battlefield.
<p>My heart grew heavy each moment we spent apart.
<p>We rode through the night and into the next day. After a day and a half of travel--
<p>Finally, we reached the battlefield.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "This is--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...What happened here?!"

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "This is--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...What happened here?!"
<p>A full half the field was nothing but a sprawling of corpses; men and horses.
<p>There were a few pockets of life, here and there. The sounds of battle fading.
<p>Those fleeing the battle saw themselves chased by a force bearing the familiar standard of the five-petal quince.
<p>(That's Nobunaga's standard!)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "It seems the battle has been decided."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That flag! Nobunaga's won, right?"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "You've learned how to tell standards apart, have you? What a clever little chatelaine."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "We will learn the rest in camp. Let us go."
<p>......
<p>We dismounted inside the Oda camp.
<p>Immediately, several soldiers who had returned from the front came to see us.
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Lady MC, you're here?! I thought you were supposed to be in Azuchi--"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Gossip later. What is [the] situation?"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Err, yes, lord! We were expecting this to be a protracted battle, but things shifted quickly."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "The Uesugi and Takeda turned to our side, and the Mouri retreated almost immediately after."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Following that, we've been chipping away at the remaining aggressors."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Is Nobunaga safe?!"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "I-is he what? Yes, my lady. He's safe."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "He took to the field towards the end, but all who saw him turned tail and fled."
<p>(So, not only is he all right, but it also sounds like he didn't even get scuffed up. Good!)
<p>I heard Sasuke sigh.
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "That's a relief."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, Sasuke! I'm sorry to make you come all the way out here on this adventure--"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "It's all right. Adventure is good for the soul. I'm only glad it turned out to be nothing."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Now, I've got some potentially unnecessary worrying about Lord Kenshin to do, so if you'll excuse me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah, definitely go check on him! And thank you for everything."
<p>Sasuke's lips curled ever so slightly before he vanished.
<p>(Was he smiling just now?)
<p>I felt like I'd gotten better at detecting the almost imperceptible changes in his expression over our journey.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "So, where is Nobunaga right now?"
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "I expect he'll be back in camp shortly--"
<p>He hadn't even finished before I caught sight of a man in black armor far off in the distance.
<p>(Nobunaga--!)
<p>The soldiers cheered at his return, but their voices barely reached me.
<p>(There he is!)
<p>However long we had been apart, it had been too long; I was on the verge of tears.
<p>Before I knew it, I was running his way.
<p>The soldiers I passed were all smiling.
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "I can't imagine anyone will think of turning against Lord Nobunaga now!"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "Right? I'm betting people will be lining up to ally with him after this!"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "Maybe we should thank the Mouri for hurrying our unification along? Haha!"
<p>He'd done it! He'd brought us all victory!
<p>I wasn't watching where I was going, but I doubted I could trip, [given] how it felt like I was running on air right now.
<p>(Nobunaga wasn't coming out here to die. Of course he wouldn't! How silly.)
<p>(I mean, between the two of us, I don't think anything COULD kill him!)
<p>I'd almost reached them.
<p>(Suppose he can hear me over all the shouting? Worth a try!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga!"
<p>He turned at the sound of my voice.
<p>And he looked almost panicked to see me.
<p>(What's wrong?)
<p>(Oh, I know what's wrong. I broke out of Azuchi Castle to get here. That's what!)
<p>(I almost don't want to tell him the reason why! He'd probably laugh at me if I said I thought he was going to d--)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Stay back!"
<p>I skidded to a halt at his commanding tone.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Gh!"
<p>Just now... was that... a gun shot?
<p>And then... and then he... he fell...
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Huh?"

    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Huh?"
    <p>Nobunaga fell with a heavy thud.
    <p>All sound disappeared. It was so quiet, except for the buzzing in my ears. I wanted to scream, just so there was noise.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobu... naga?"
    <p>(W-why did he...?)
    <p>Playing back the last few seconds in my head was like watching an old-timey movie. Everythign scuffed and skipping.
    <p>(...That sound... that gunshot... He...)
    <p>I wanted to scream for a different reason.
    <p>My heartbeat was slow and rumbling like thunder; my head a dark fog.
    <p>(...That's not possible though... the battle was over... it was over! And we--!)
    <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "What are you just standing there for?!"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ah..."
    <p>There was sound again.
    <p>It was Ieyasu who spoke.
    <p>Time began to move.
    <p>(I-I have to...!)
    <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "We need to stop the bleeding! Get me bandages and disinfectant! NOW!"
    <p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Y-yes, my lord!"
    <p>(I gotta help too!)
    <p>But why couldn't I move?
    <p>The healers began to carry Nobunaga away.
    <p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Excuse me, my lady."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "U-uh..."
    <p>I tried to get out of their way and stumbled.
    <p>(W-wait... I need to... go with him!)
    <p>I couldn't even right myself. Just then, someone gently took my shoulder, propped me upright, kept me supported.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Keiji...?"
    <p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I got you."
    <p>He helped me follow after Nobunaga.
    <p>They carried him inside the main tent, and unauthorized [entry] was forbidden.
    <p>The Oda warlords all bore the same stony look on their face.
    <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...We've removed the bullet."
    <p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "And the bleeding? Has it stopped?"
    <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "For the moment."
    <p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...How bad is it?"
    <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "On the outside? Not too bad. But there's a high chance it did a lot of internal damage we can't see yet."
    <p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "They shot from far away. A regular matchlock's hardly lethal at that distance."
    <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "I'd want to say the same here, but it's not a regular matchlock. The internal damage and bleeding could turn this bad. Fast."
    <p>Ieyasu stopped talking to everyone and spoke directly to me.
    <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "It's up to his stamina and luck."
    <p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...I wish I could give you a better prognosis, but this seemed kinder than lying to you."
    <p>Ieyasu wasn't that great at being gentle. Still, I felt his sympathy in how he spoke to me.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Thank you."
    <p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "We must talk about what happens next. Everyone but MC, outside."
    <p>Mitsuhide led everyone out of the tent.
    <p>(I don't know whether he meant that or whether he's just giving us alone time.)
    <p>I couldn't really think that hard. Not now.
    <p>I approached Nobunaga, still on his bed.
    <p>(It's funny. Even though I saw him lose consciousness, it's like he's just sleeping.)
    <p>(...He's has this same exact look on his face when he falls asleep on my lap.)
    <p>A powerful smile; a teasing glint in his eyes; but an utterly innocent sleeping face.
    <p>(You wouldn't look this way if you weren't going to wake up, right?)
    <p>There were no answers to the questions I asked myself.
    <p>I was so angry and so sad and so... so...!
    <p>I bit down on my lip before I could cry.
    <p>(...If I start crying over him now, it's like I'm admitting to myself he's not coming back.)
    <p>(I won't cry... at least, not here.)
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hey... Do you remember me telling you about movies? Cause there's [a] textbook plot that happens in [movies] all the time."
    <p>I took hold of Nobunaga's hand.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "When everything seems hopeless, all it takes is a kiss. Someone wakes up, and everyone lives happily ever after."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Well, that's how it goes in fairy tale movies. And, honestly, it's usually the princess that's in trouble or asleep."
    <p>I kissed his hand. It recalled a memory.
    <p>......
    <p>It was the day after Nobunaga told me he was not taking me to battle--
    <p>Of course I'd been hurt and surprised initially, but with time, I'd calmed down.
    <p>We were bac on good terms. But were we on speaking terms--?
    <p>(He's acting unusual again.)
    <p>I really didn't know! Because he hadn't said anything to me since coming to my room!
    <p>He just silently held my hand and ran his fingers through my hair.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Say, Nobunaga?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What?"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm just wondering what's wrong."
    <p>I gave his hand a little squeeze. He stopped.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I do not know why this is, however--"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...It seems that I was waiting for you to hold my hand back."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Um?"
    <p>(Oh, I get it now.)
    <p>(Those four days I was out... He must have been holding my hand, waiting for me to hold his back.)
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "You're really leaving without me?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "How many times must I explain it? You will stay in Azuchi."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's not that I don't get it--it's that I still think I can change your mind, maybe."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is only for a short while."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah, but the war's not going to be short. You don't know when it will end, do you?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I know."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh yeah, how?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Because I have to end it quickly."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And once I have decided on something, it will come true."
    <p>......
    <p>(Maybe I'm still asleep? Asleep at Azuchi, waiting for you to save me like you promised.
    <p>(Maybe this is all a dream?)
    <p>I drew near his face. His pale lips.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "If this is all some dream I'm seeing--"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Wake me with your kiss."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Please, Nobunaga..."
    <p>I kissed him, praying as I did--
    <p>(...Save me from this nightmare.)
