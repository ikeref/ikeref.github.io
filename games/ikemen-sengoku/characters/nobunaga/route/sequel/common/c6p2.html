  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 6 (6-10)</h1>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p>I left Nobunaga in the tent. Honestly, I don't know how I made it out myself, I was so unsteady on my feet.
<p>(Huh... It's already so late...)
<p>It was only then I realized how cold it was.
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "I don't believe this!"
<p>(Someone... shouting?)
<p>Gathered around the fire, I saw several soldiers venting about what had happened.
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "What kind of warrior would sneak in and shoot the enemy commander after the battle's already been decided?!"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "...They may not have honor, but they did get the upper hand on us."
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "What did you say?!"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "I'm saying it's our fault for letting them even get that close to our lord!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey, guys, hey! Knock it off."
<p>Keiji appeared, a drinking gourd in hand.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Yeah, what they did was scummy, but arguing about it is just going to waste our energy, all right?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You still wanna be arguing this stuff when our lord recovers? What'll he say when he sees you like this, huh?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Besides, we won the battle. Now come on. Drink up and get some rest, all right?"
<p>He shook his sake-filled gourd with an audible sloosh and smiled wide.
<p>(...Even now, Keiji's keeping everyone's spirits up. Or at least, he's trying.)
<p>From where I stood, even his lively attitude couldn't lift the heavy mood surrounding us.
<p><strong>Soldier 3:</strong> "...Victory sake doesn't taste good on a night like this..."
<p><strong>Soldier 4:</strong> "Yeah. What if Lord Nobunaga doesn't wake up again? How're we--?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "That's ENOUGH!"
<p>It was a shout that shook the air.
<p>I was still tingling as I turned around.
<p>It had been Hideyoshi, of all people. His soothing air gone, he shot sharp, belligerent looks at the talking soldiers.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "The next person to say that crap is gonna be the one who doesn't wake up tomorrow!"
<p><strong>Soldier 4:</strong> "I-I'm sorry, my lord!"
<p>(...Hideyoshi, you're...)
<p>I think it must have been seeing Hideyoshi out of sorts that made it all sink in for me.
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "All right now, cool your head, Hideyoshi. Yelling at guys who are already feeling bad isn't going to help anyone."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...You're right. And I know that! It's just hard to hold myself together..."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I know what you mean. Especially after he sent that message to us..."
<p>(Message?)
<p>MC:</strong> "What message?"
<p>The warlords seemingly hadn't noticed me until then. I got a couple of anxious looks.
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Just before our victory, Nobunaga sent out a message to all of us."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "He figured if Kicho set this battle up, then he'd have some plan in mind to sabotage it for the Oda should we win."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Are you saying that Nobunaga possibly knew he'd be shot...?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "It seemed he figured he'd be a target as soon as it was over, that's for sure."
<p>(If he warned everyone about that, then he was on the lookout for it. Meaning he didn't really plan on dying...?)
<p>(If that's the case, then my bad premonition would have been all in my head. And I'd like to think so, but--)
<p>...But I couldn't ask him now.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "If only we had known how Kicho would strike..."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "We could have made sure that Lord Nobunaga was better protected or--"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "...Let me stop you there, lad. It won't help anyong to think that way."
<p>(Why?)
<p>I'd been out of my head with shock and confusion. But now I felt angry.
<p>(Why didn't you tell me any of this, Nobunaga?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I just wish he'd have told me if he knew this was a possibility."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "If you wish to know, I can certainly answer the question of why he told you nothing."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "For if you knew, would you have ever let him leave your side?"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "He did not wish to involve you, MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I don't care about that!"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Well then, what would you have done--rather, what COULD you have done if you knew what was coming?"
<p>Mitsuhide knew just how to twist the knife.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Probably nothing! I don't know!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I could have...! I could have at least tried to throw myself in the way when he--!"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "DON'T YOU DARE!"
<p>(Wha... Who...?)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Don't you dare finish saying that!"

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p><strong>???:</strong> "DON'T YOU DARE!"
<p>(Wha... Who...?)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Don't you dare finish saying that!"
<p>It took me a second to see Keiji. To realize that it was his shout of anger and rage.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Keiji?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Can't you see that he left you behind because he knew you might've done that?"
<p>He fixed me with a serious stare.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Can't you see that you're more important to him than his own life?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I..."
<p>(...I know that...)
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will not be taking you to battle."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I won't repeat myself. You will stay in Azuchi."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You must... wait patiently for my return."
<p>......
<p>(I know that Nobunaga was keeping this all private to protect me.)
<p>(But I would have taken a bullet for him! I would have gladly died in his place!)
<p>(Anything if it meant he didn't--...!)
<p>(As long as I didn't have to lose him...!!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Hic...!"
<p>The tears I'd held back in Nobunaga's tent came rushing out all at once.
<p>I managed not to turn into a complete bawling mess, but still...
<p>I couldn't stop myself from crying.
<p>(...I- I shouldn't cry. It's unfair when everyone's upset about this too.)
<p>(It's childish to make this about me and--!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I-I'm... sorry... I know everyone's... hurting..."
<p>Something blocked my vision as I tried to stop, or at least slow my tears.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Mm...?"
<p>Then I realized it wasn't a something so much as a someone.
<p>It was Keiji. He held me against his chest.
<p>His hand on my head was a little rough, but it was gentle too.
<p>Before I knew it, I was crying again.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...T-thanks..."
<p>That was all I could choke out before I felt a sob coming on. I clamped my mouth shut and wept, silently.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Lord Nobunaga trusted us with that information. And we failed him..."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Damn. Dammit all to hell..."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Lord Hideyoshi. Please don't blame yourself."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "What we need right now is a strategy."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Or else Kicho will have truly succeeded in robbing our victory from us."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...You're right. Sorry. Heh, guess I'm not too suited for being called 'lord' like this."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Not at all. It's..."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I'm sorry too. It's just that if I don't put my mind to something, I'm afraid of being overwhelmed by the current situation..."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Don't feel bad about keeping a cool head."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "The cost for this victory was too high. If you can call it that. With Lord Nobunaga out, we're back in a precarious state."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Kicho really worked us over."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I cannot fathom what my wayward kinsman experienced during his absence--"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "...but it seems of doing anything to get his way has only grown."
<p>I tried to pay attention to what everyone was saying, but I couldn't hold onto anything right now.
<p>(...I just have to keep wishing...)
<p>(Please, Nobunaga. Please don't die.)
<p>(You know I would do any foolish and dangerous thing for you too, right?)
<p>...Had it been hours or only minutes?
<p>All I knew was that eventually, I stopped crying. I calmed down some too.
<p>Keiji had stayed with me all the while.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thank you. I'm all right now."
<p>He released me.
<p>It took him a few seconds before he said anything though.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I've got something I wanna talk to you about. Alone. That okay...?"

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What did you want to talk about?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...I spoke with Nobunaga. Before the battle."
<p>(He did?)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I asked him why he left you. I mean, you looked pretty devastated when we left."
<p>(I was pretty sad, yeah.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What did he say?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "He said, 'her emotions are her own problem. We cannot control others' minds.'"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "'But we can protect. And I will protect her.'"
<p>(Nobunaga...)
<p>I had to steer my thoughts away from him and focus on Keiji's voice else I'd begin crying again.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "There's another thing."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "He didn't say it, but he had this look--"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Like he was saying, 'No matter what happens, no matter how much I make her cry, I will be beside her till the end.'"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...So, ya know, I wanted you to hear that it's probably gonna be okay."
<p>Keiji wasn't his usual boisterous self. His voice was soft. A little hesitant.
<p>(Still... you really are great at lifting people's moods, Keiji. Mine especially.)
<p>Even without that big sunny smile on his face, he was plenty warm.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thanks for telling me."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Don't mention it."
<p>I smiled. And Keiji finally smiled too.
<p>We were forcing ourselves, but it let us release some of that awful stillness that clung to everyone since this afternoon...
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Honestly, I thought he should've just told you himself rather than let you worry."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You wouldn't have flown all the way out here if not for him."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...It's not Nobunaga's fault."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "How?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sasuke, that is, a friend of mine told me--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga went to him to ask about the history of this period... or should I say, what's going to happen in the future."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Hold up. You said 'Sasuke'. You know Sasuke? Like, THAT Sasuke?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Um, I know one Sasuke, and he's a pretty good fit for 'THAT Sasuke'. You know him?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Kenshin Uesugi's ninja?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah, that's him. He also someone from my future. He came to the past with me."
<p>Keiji looked gob smacked.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And in our version of this time period's history, Nobunaga... he dies before completing unification."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I thought that in order to protect me, Nobunaga might have been trying to restore that history by dying..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's why I came out here."
<p>(I'm still a little worried that was his plan...)
<p>Perhaps things were going exactly the way he wanted?
<p>The possibility chilled me.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...This was all my fault."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Keiji?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I was the one who helped Lord Nobunaga set up that meeting with Sasuke."
<p>(Keiji did that?)
<p>MC:</strong> "But why? How?!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "It came out that I'm friends with someone on the Uesugi side. Our lord agreed to let that go if I got them in contact."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Meaning, what happened to Lord Nobunaga was probably all--"

<ul>
    <li><strong>"It's not."</strong></li>
    <li>"Don't say that."</li>
    <li>"Let's not."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's not."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga would have found another way to meet up with Sasuke. It just might have been harder, that's all."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But he would have done it regardless. That's the kind of man he is."
<p>("What if Keiji hadn't arranged for Nobunaga and Sasuke to meet?")
<p>("What if Sasuke hadn't spoiled everything to Nobunaga?" No. I won't go down this road.)
<p>(I don't want to blame anyone, and I don't want to hold this against anyone.)
<p>We grew quiet once more.
<p>......
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Hmph."

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Hmph."
<p>Like a moonbeam, Kicho, dressed in white, stood on a high cliff and looked down upon the battlefield.
<p>A man in dingy clothes approached him, bowing reverently.
<p><strong>???:</strong> "I've returned."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "And your mission?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "A success."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "...That him? The guy who shot a hole in Nobunaga?"
<p>They were joined by the Mouri clan leader; Kicho frowned when he saw him.
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Weren't you in the middle of fleeing?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "I'm letting my vassals do the running. That's their job, far as I can tell."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "And? You had your man shoot Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Yes, I did."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "It is not a fatal injury. Simply a debilitating one."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "That's why it was necessary I hire one of the magoichi, Saika's famed mercenaries."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "They're the best marksmen in Japan."
<p><strong>Disguised Man:</strong> "That said, sir, I can't promise he'll live. There are many complications that can follow a gunshot wound."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I understand. It won't really matter whether he lives or dies."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "He was to be the spark that kept the flames of war burning."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "If his fire goes out, I'll find another."
<p>......
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Nobunaga... has been shot?"
<p>Kennyo and the others were en route to Azuchi when a pallid messenger gave the report to their escort.
<p>Kennyo and Ranmaru were as disturbed by the news as the Oda troops.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I-is he going to be all right?"
<p><strong>Messenger:</strong> "I cannot tell you [any more] right now."
<p>The messenger rode off.
<p>Ranmaru grew quiet. There was a haunted paleness to his own features. Kennyo cast an understanding look his way.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...You worry for him?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Ah--I'm sorry, Master."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "There is no need to apologize."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...If I may, I wish you to describe to me, the kind of man you saw Nobunaga as."
<p>Ranmaru's eyes widened. He hadn't expected Kennyo would want to talk about Nobunaga in this way.
<p>Hesitantly, he began speaking.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "He has a very strong will. I saw immediately that htere was no sacrifice he wouldn't make for his goals."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "And I hated that."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I knew that I would never forgive man who killed our friends. Our family. Destroyed our home."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "It was frightening, working under him. Often, I was scared of what he'd do..."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "But I saw how people put their faith in him. So many of them did."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I couldn't understand how they'd trust their dreams and ambitions to this man. And so I asked him--"
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You wish to say something, Ranmaru."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...No, my lord."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not lie to me. Speak."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Why... why do you kill so many people? How can you do it--?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Don't you feel anything for them?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...Aren't you afraid one day the people who hate you for what you've done will come seeking revenge...?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Am I afraid?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are awfully emotional, Ranmaru."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If I let fear of what others would do to me stop me, then I am not worthy of the goal of uniting this land."
<p>......
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "You see, Lord Nobunaga had long ago figured out I was a spy and a survivor of the Hongan-ji massacre."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "He counted on my abilities in spite of that. He let me get closer to him than anyone else. And he kept me there."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "As if to challenge me. Was my hatred enough to stop what he sought to accomplish?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "And could his goal be something that could even bring hope to those who had suffered and lost so much?"
<p>Kennyo listened quietly as Ranmaru pieced together his feelings on the man.
<p>Suddenly, Ranmaru looked up.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...I'm sorry, Master! I didn't mean to talk for so long about--!"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I told you there is no need to apologize."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Thank you for telling me."
<p>Kennyo patted Ranmaru's head.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "And... forgive me for all the suffering I have put you through..."

<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p>(...Midnight already.)
<p>I hadn't realized how much time had passed since I'd last checked on Nobunaga.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I think I'm going to check on him..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Don't you think you should get some rest?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "How am I supposed to rest like this?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...If he dies, I swear I'm gonna follow after him and sock him in the face for you!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ahah... I don't know if that's a good idea."
<p>Smiling, I put one foot in front of the other. But something was... not quite right.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "H-huh?"
<p>(I don't feel... so...)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "MC!"
<p>Keiji was there the second I'd started to collapse. He caught me and held me up.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...You okay?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Y-yeah. Sorry..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Look, I'd take you to Lord Nobunaga but there's no place to rest there."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I'm gonna carry you to the medical tent. That okay with you?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You can see our lord again once you're able to get back on your feet."
<p>Realizing I wasn't in a good position to persuade him, I relented to his suggestion. Keiji picked me up in his arms.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Right. Thanks."
<p>(...I can't feel my body...)
<p>(Is this shock from what happened to Nobunaga?)
<p>(Or--)
<p>(Or has Kicho done something else?)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Go and put whatever's in your mind out."
<p>Keiji seemed to know the second bad thoughts loomed in.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I know your mind can head in some bad places when stuff like this happens."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Get some rest. And get some damn color back into your cheeks, okay?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Else Lord Nobunaga's gonna pass out again when he sees you--with fright!"
<p>Keiji was a little more short with me. Perhaps he wanted it to sink in this time.
<p>Still, I found relief in his slightly rough tone.
<p>(I wonder if this is closer to what he's like on the inside?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thanks... again."
<p>Then I passed out.
<p>......
<p>Keiji looked down at MC, who lay unconscious in his arms. He fought off the tears that stung insistently at his eyes.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...You'd better wake up again. Else I'll never forgive you..."
<p>At the same time--
<p><strong>Ieyasu's Voice:</strong> "...Hideyoshi! Come quick!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Ieyasu?"
<p>Hideyoshi had been watching the fire beside the tent where Nobunaga rested.
<p>The rising pitch of Ieyasu's voice roused him to his feet immediately.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "What is it? What's--"
<p>He ran inside the tent; his breath caught.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Lord Nobunaga...!"
