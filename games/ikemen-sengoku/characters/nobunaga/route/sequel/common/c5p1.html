  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 5 (1-5)</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I'll do anything to stop Master Kennyo."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "But I can't do it alone."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I need your help. Please..."
<p>He disappeared quickly after handing over the letter.
<p>I returned inside and processed everything that had just happened.
<p>(Ranmaru wants to keep Kennyo from going through with his revenge and hurting himself further.)
<p>He had his concerns, surely, but Ranmaru looked calm and resolute.
<p>(The ability to put the person you love before all else is amazing.)
<p>(...Would I be able to do the same thing if I were in his position?)
<p>I tucked the letter away.
<p>Just then, the door slid open.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are awake? How are you feeling?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "My body's still a bit weak, but I took a walk in the garden and was just fine."
<p>I took a quick look at Nobunaga.
<p>(He doesn't seem as miserable as he did yesterday. That's good.)
<p>(Actually, he seems really content.)
<p>(Maybe nothing happened while I was unconscious? Well, nothing I need to worry about, that is.)
<p>(He could have been upset because he was so worried. That makes sense.)
<p>(...What doesn't make sense is him not telling me I'd been out for four days. I should really ask him about that.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Why do you look at me that way? Does something about my face displease you?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Definitely not! I think your face is perfect."
<p>I flashed him a brief smile before getting to the issue at hand.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's just, you could have told me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Told you what?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...About the fact that I was asleep for a whole four days."
<p>Perhaps he was surprised I knew.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm sorry to leave you alone for so long."
<p>Nobunaga said nothing.
<p>The crinkle in his brow deepened though.
<p>(Yeah, that look tells me he was far more than worried.)
<p>In which case, it was my turn to be strong.
<p>(I can't reassure him that it will never happen again, but--)
<p>MC:</strong> "The good news is, I'm here now."
<p>Nobunaga was back to looking shocked. Still, it was an upgrade from sad!
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Back to my original concern. Why didn't you let me know I'd been--?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...If you are able to walk, walk with me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hmm?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I wish to see the castle town with you at my side."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Come along."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hold on--!"
<p>He took my hand and led me out without giving me much choice in the matter.
<p>(Ahh, there goes my question.)
<p>I caught a few more glimpses at his face as we passed through the castle dates. Nothing I saw answered my question.
<p>(...On the other hand, a date with Nobunaga is a surprisingly good deal.)
<p>(I didn't think he'd have time for one what with a big war looming.)
<p>In the end, I tried to be positive about it. Well, I didn't need to try TOO hard. I was genuinely happy about this.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Where are we going?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I haven't decided."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "So, this is a long walk date?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I am not familiar with the concept. Is that a common thing in your time?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Kind of. You and your boyfriend hold hands and get all cuddly, enjoying each other's company more than the destination!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then yes, I suppose--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...This is a long walk date."

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then yes, I suppose--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...This is a long walk date."
<p>Nobunaga seemed so amused to say it.
<p>(Ah... I love it when he adopts modernisms!)
<p>(He's so cute! Oh, speaking of cute--)
<p>(I meant to give Ranmaru's information over to him. I should remember to do that.)
<p><strong>Merchant 1:</strong> "Goodness, if it isn't our lord! How can we help you? Something for the war?"
<p><strong>Merchant 2:</strong> "We're happy to contribute anything we can for the cause, free of charge!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then continue your business as usual. That will do our country better than flattery."
<p><strong>Merchant 2:</strong> "As you say, my lord!"
<p><strong>Merchant 1:</strong> "You make a good point!"
<p>(...But maybe now's not the time.)
<p>I kept an eye on him though, as we caught up with the various merchants and others.
<p>(I always like seeing how the townspeople treat Nobunaga. It shows his policies are working.)
<p>(Even with a nasty war on the horizon, everyone trusts he'll protect them.)
<p><strong>Tea Proprietress:</strong> "Princess, it's nice to see you again!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nice to see you too! It's so good to be back on my feet."
<p><strong>Tea Proprietress:</strong> "So, that rumor about you being under the weather was true? Poor dear. In any case, I'm glad you seem better."
<p><strong>Tea Proprietress:</strong> "What do you say? Would you and the lord like to have some tea and sweets?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That sounds perfect!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We shall dine here then."
<p>At my enthusiasm, Nobunaga nodded and put an arm around my shoulder.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You mentioned hand holding earlier. Is holding you this way not acceptable?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Maybe a little inconvenient for dining."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Is that an invitation to continue once we are done?"
<p><strong>Tea Proprietress:</strong> "I see you two are as sweet on each other as always!"
<p>I was already blushing thanks to Nobunaga, but my face grew ten degrees hotter when the proprietress laughed.
<p><strong>Tea Proprietress:</strong> "Come on in, now!"
<p>(I suppose it's nice to know we can bring a little joy to the people in these times.)
<p>We sat down on the red cloth benc as tea and sweets were brought to us.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Those are cute looking!"
<p>The sweets were round and pinwheel like. They had a soft, translucent pink color.
<p><strong>Husband:</strong> "We borroed some sugar and hard candy from Lord Nobunaga the other day--"
<p><strong>Husband:</strong> "...and with it were able to replicate this new type of crystal sugar candy the Nanban traders spoke of."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Your craftsmanship is excellent, comparable to the original."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Continue polishing your craft, so that I may see your work presented at some celebratory affair or another."
<p><strong>Husband:</strong> "Your words are too much, my liege."
<p>The proprietress's husband bowed to us before returning to the kitchen.
<p>(They're really pretty. That pink, peachy color reminds me of--)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ah!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What is it?"
<p>Nobunaga had just tossed one of the treats into his mouth.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I've got something to give you."
<p>I pulled the letter out of my kimono.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ranmaru gave this to me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You met with him?"

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ranmaru gave this to me."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You met with him?"
<p>(No need to hide it. Ranmaru may have turned against him for Kennyo's sake, but he's no enemy to Nobunaga now.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes. When I was walking in the garden."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He is talented indeed to be able to infiltrate into the inner palace."
<p>Funny how Nobunaga seemed pleased.
<p>He took the letter and opened it.
<p>(I haven't looked at it myself.)
<p>(But it should have information on Kennyo and how Ranmaru wants to stop him.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...He has finally made up his mind?"
<p>(Nobunaga's smiling again. Huh.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What did Ranmaru write?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He wishes to capture Kennyo before he can join the Mouri in battle."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And for that, he seeks our assistance."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sounds just like what he told me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ranmaru said he thinks we can free Kennyo from his hate without, you know, letting him kill you."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But to be freed, Kennyo needs to be alive."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I hope you can work together to find a way to spare him, please?"
<p>(Ranmaru couldn't bear losing either Nobunaga or Kennyo. They're both important to him.)
<p>Nobunaga:</strong> "That depends on how things go."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...That's... fair."
<p>(If Ranmaru can't get through to Kennyo, Nobunaga may have to stop him by force...)
<p>(...But I hope Ranmaru's plan works!)
<p>If it did... well, that was one less problem to worry about--in a sea of problems.
<p>(So many threats looming. Motonari Mouri, Kenshin Uesugi, Shingen Takeda...)
<p>(I really hope we don't have to count Kennyo among them.)
<p>(I trust in the Oda forces' strength, which is exactly why I'm worried for them. Our enemies are too crafty.)
<p>(And if we have more traitors before the battle? We're shaken up enough as is.)
<p>(...But I won't be shaken! I'll take after Ranmaru and be firm in my resolve.)
<p>I'd no sooner made that decision when--
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, I must tell you something."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sure. What is it?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will not be taking you to battle."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But--"
<p>(What does he mean, he won't take me?)
<p>(I know it sounds like a weird thing to question after how much I hated it at first, but to quit now?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Why?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Because you are not in perfect condition."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "This is about me being asleep for four days? I'll get my strength back in time for--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I won't repeat myself. You will stay in Azuchi."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I..."
<p>(I know he's right.)
<p>(This would be a bad time to go, when I could pass out on the battlefield at any moment.)
<p>(At the same time, hearing I can't be with him at this important juncture is just...!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You must... wait patiently for my return."
<p>For a moment, he looked away.
<p>(Hmm?)
<p>That tiny action disturbed me greatly.
<p>(Why did he break his gaze...?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "This long walk date is my way of giving you something to recall in my absence."
<p>(...It's like he's hiding something.)
<p>I couldn't pinpoint why I felt that.
<p>But all the worry I'd neatly tucked away came spilling back out with that action.
<p>Suddenly everything became suspicious.
<p>(So, if he is hiding something, then his earlier deflection would be on purpose.)
<p>(And this could all tie back to his strange mood the other night...!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Nobunaga, I challenge you!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You challenge me to what?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "To a game of Go! Same terms as before, but if I win, you'll let me go with you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Very well. I accept."

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "To a game of Go! Same terms as before, but if I win, you'll let me go with you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Very well. I accept."
<p>......
<p>(I've got to win this.)
<p>(I can't put my finger on the reason why, but I can't let Nobunaga go off on his own.)
<p>The normally soothing clack of the stones was maddening to me now, which was awful because I needed a cool head!
<p>(C'mon, me! Where'd all that training go?!)
<p>Nobunaga kept his cool.
<p>He was also as ruthless as usual.
<p>It was easy to see he had command of the board. Each move precise.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Ugh."
<p>There'd been no victory or fun in this match. And now it was over.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I... lost."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "So it seems."
<p>He straightened up and looked down at me.
<p>My loss began to weigh on me. It had been a while since the stakes felt this high.
<p>(Can he sense I'm worried about him?)
<p>(Is there some reason beside my health that he won't take me along?)
<p>(...What is it about my presence that would make things inconvenient for him?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Now you will promise aloud you will not leave Azuchi until the war with the Mouri and their allies is over."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Are you serious?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga, this is going to be the biggest war we've faced yet, right?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You're really telling me to stay put through the whole thing?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I won. You will say it."
<p>(Not only does he know I'm onto him, he won't tell me anything!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Say you will not leave Azuchi."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You agreed to using our previous terms."
<p>I kept silent.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You are too stubborn. Do you want me to force the words out of you?"
<p>He caught my chin in his long fingers.
<p>(You're going to have to, as I'm not going to give in like this!)
<p>The sick feeling in my heart wouldn't let me.

<ul>
    <li>(I'm afraid...)</li>
    <li>"If you're worried..."</li>
    <li><strong>"I'm your lucky charm."</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You dragged me along to battles before, even when I begged you not to! And you know what? You protected me."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm your lucky charm, aren't I...?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You are. And that will not change no matter how far apart we are."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Just--...!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do you intend to renege on not just this bet but the previous one?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "The previous one?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You don't recall? I made you promise you would forgive and allow any dangerous, foolish thing I do to save you."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...This is what I want you to say..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Say that no matter what foolish and dangerous thing I will do to save you--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...you will forgive and allow it."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I promise... No matter what foolish thing you do to protect me--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I will always... even if it's me alone... I will always forgive you..."
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I said that, yes, but that was only--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Only what?"
<p>Would I really tell him I lost on purpose? That he forced those words out of me?
<p>(I can't look him in the eyes and say that.)
<p>It wasn't true, anyway. I was happy for it then, and I said those words gladly.
<p>(He's really leaving me behind to save me?)
<p>(Am I feeling nervous over nothing?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Are the words we share so meaningless to you that you would take them back?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No! I wouldn't... do that."
<p>(And I won't go back on this latest bet that I stubbornly brought to him, either.)
<p>(But there's only so much I'll agree to.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I promise that I will not leave Azuchi to go with you as you march to war."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Ah, meaning you intend to follow after?"

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Ah, meaning you intend to follow after?"
<p>Nobunaga smiled confidently.
<p>(Normally, I love that smile of his; right now, I hated it.)
<p>It didn't ease my distress.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Just do one thing for me?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Come back safe."
<p>I placed my hand on his heart.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Who do you think I am?"
<p>He showed no fear or confusion as before.
<p>(Is he telling me I can trust him?)
<p>In the end, I wasn't able to learn what secret thoughts he kept in his heart.
<p>So all I could do was pray for him.
<p>Several days later.
<p>Their preparations complete, the Oda forces marched to battle against the Mouri's alliance.
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh boy..."
<p>(He really left me here...)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Excuse me. I don't suppose there's been any updates on the battle?"
<p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> "...Updates?"
<p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> "Sorry. We've only heard that the warlords who aligned themselves with the Mouri are also on the march."
<p>I spoke to the guard outside my room.
<p>They weren't there to keep me IN my room. Just in the castle. They followed me whenever I left though.
<p>(Nobunaga was serious about me not coming with him. Gotta hand it to him.)
<p>(...Except that no, I don't!)
<p>At first, I was sad about him leaving. Now, I was growing increasingly angry at him!
<p>(Putting me under all this protection just makes me want to escape!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Soo, what are you doing tonight--?"
<p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> "My lady?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That came out wrong. When do you go on break? Like, how long does your shift last?"
<p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga ordered you be protected all day long, so I'll be here until night."
<p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> "When the night shift arrives to replace me, I'll be resting for the next shift."
<p>(I'm never not under guard. Wonderful.)
<p>Angry and depressed. Just then--
<p>I heard a weird sound in the ceiling.
<p>(Hmm? The ceiling...!)
<p>I looked up, only to see--
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sa--!"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Shh!"
<p>(Shoot!)
<p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> "Is something the matter?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...S-sat on a pin while I thought I might get some sewing done! Silly me!"
<p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> "Are you injured? Should I call someone to check on you?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No, no, no! It didn't even hurt! I'm good!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...But as you noticed, I like to talk to myself when I'm sewing, so don't think too much about anything you hear, okay?"
<p><strong>Bodyguard:</strong> "Understood, my lady."
<p>Surprisingly, that seemed to work. Sasuke soundlessly dropped to the floor.
<p>We talked as quietly as possible.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "So, what are you doing here, 'pin'?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...There was something I had to tell you."
<p>(Oh... Sasuke, you don't look too good.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Are you experiencing any side effects from the recent changes to history?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...Unfortunately, yes. That's why I've been furloughed for this upcoming battle."
<p>(I worried as much.)
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I've heard it's the same for you?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Heard that from who?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "That's what I came to talk to you about."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "You see, Nobunaga Oda came to see me while you were unconscious."
<p>MC:</strong> "Aha!"
<p>(That's what happened? He met with Sasuke while I was out?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What did you two talk about?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "We... that is, I--"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...I told him about the future."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "As many details about history following the Honno-ji incident as I could."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You gave him spoilers?!"
