  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 3 (6-10)</h1>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p><strong>Subordinate:</strong> "Lord Kanetsugu."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "What do you have for me?"
<p><strong>Subordinate:</strong> "About the merchant who came selling weapons the other day. They're with the pirates who raided Kicho's ships."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Just as we guessed. And how are the pirates connected with Kicho?"
<p><strong>Subordinate:</strong> "We've got nothing yet. But one of the men we've sent to infiltrate them came back with some worrying information."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "The name of their leader?"
<p><strong>Subordinate:</strong> "...You already knew?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "No, but since we knew the attacks were faked, it only makes sense Kicho would be discerning in choosing his business partner."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "It's highly unlike that would turn out to be some lawless nobody."
<p><strong>Subordinate:</strong> "I see."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "So, who is he?"
<p><strong>Subordinate:</strong> "Well--"
<p>Kanetsugu's violet eyes narrowed sharply.
<p>Everything came together in his mind in a flash, and he was soon on the move.
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "...If that's the case, they'll be approaching the Uesugi-Takeda alliance soon. Very soon."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "I have a letter to write. See it is delivered to... see it reaches 'Jisei'."
<p><strong>Subordinate:</strong> "Yes, sir."
<p>......
<p>At the same time, in a secluded temple.
<p>Kennyo quietly read the letter he'd been given, his expression heavy.
<p>When he was done, he held it over the fire and watched it burn.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...Master Kennyo?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Who was that letter from?"
<p>Seeing the last of the burnt paper crumple into ash in the flames only worried Ranmaru further.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Was it possibly--?"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Do not let this worry you, Ranmaru."
<p>Kennyo cut him off, as to keep them both from facing further painful questions.
<p>He touched his shoulder, the wound Nobunaga had left on his back that day in the rain--another scar--still aching.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Twice now you have tended to grievous wounds of mine."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I remember how you looked at what had become of my face when Hongan-ji fell."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Yet you took care of me devotedly."
<p>Kennyo touched his face, recalling the past. Strange how he spoke fondly of it now...
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master, why are you--?"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I wanted to thank you."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Aww... But come on. Really, why are you bringing all this up now...?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "You saved my life and gave it purpose. You're my master and teacher. Of course I'd do this for you."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...I would not be able to move again after our clash at Hongan-ji [were] it not for you."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I had come to believe that this time, I would finally die."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "But it seems heaven has decreed there will be no rest for me in life either."
<p>There was a note of bitter resentment in Kennyo's voice. Ranmaru barely held himself together.
<p>Tamping down the pain, he placed a warm haori over Kennyo's shoulders and smiled.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...You can rest now, if you need."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I'll look after you."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You are very kind. Be proud of that."
<p>Kennyo offered him a gentle smile and patted him on the head.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I have been called to join the war against Nobunaga. I know that I am only being used, but I shall let them use me."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "M-master...!"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Well, if that's what you've decided, it'll be okay! I'll be with you all the--"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You must not come."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...What...?"

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Well, if that's what you've decided, it'll be okay! I'll be with you all the--"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You must not come."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...What...?"
<p>Ranmaru's eyes shot open upon hearing the words he'd feared most to hear.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "D-don't say that!! Why can't I?!"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I have sesn what happens to you each time we receive news of the rebellions in Oda territory here in our hideout."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Did you think I would ignore your pain?"
<p>Ranmaru shook his head silently. He was still in disbelief.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I see how your heart is torn in twain with the desire to help Nobunaga and... that young woman with him."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Not as much as you, Master--!"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Ranmaru. I am not blaming you."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I will never be free from the haunting cries of my brethren whom I failed to protect."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "They call me down this path. Even though I see clearly it leads to my own destruction."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...But you do not carry my burden. There is no reason you should die with me."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master Kennyo, wait, please! Don't!"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I will not let this final chance go. I must see that his life ends here."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "If you are conflicted about that, then it is best we go our separate ways. Do not follow me, Ranmaru."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master... Kennyo...!"
<p>Kennyo took up his staff and gave him a last stern glance before leaving.
<p>Ranmaru shot up to follow him, but his legs were trembling too badly to move.
<p><srong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I..."
<p>......
<p>Nobunaga gave orders to repair the bridge over the Seta river, after which, we returned to Azuchi.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "You no longer wish us to prepare a defense as you go to Sakai, but to prepare for war?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "What the hell happened out there?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We met with Kicho."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He has arranged for us to go to battle. I have reason to believe whoever our opponent is, they are already on the move."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Did he confess to being behind the artillery strike and the rebellions?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He might as well have."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Kicho claimed he would stop my unification and alter the world of the future 500 years from now."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Sorry, my lord, but where did this talk of 500 years suddenly come from?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is easier to show you than to explain. MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Take out your 'traveler's guide'"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I've got it here."
<p>I handed the guide book over to Nobunaga.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "This is an article from 500 years in the future where MC comes from."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...What the?! That's one heck of a surprise!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "MC comes from 500 years in the future?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I know. I had a hard time believing her at first myself."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Honestly, it's the only thing that explains her ridiculously ditzy, peace-loving attitude."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "And they call me the weird one. If you're making this up, MC, I'm officially handing my title over to you."
<p>Keiji looked at me a moment before shrugging.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...But looks like you're telling the truth."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "So, why pull out that book of hers now?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Because the parts of it that talk about us and our immediate history have begun to disappear."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Is that so?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "They've... disappeared?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "According to Kicho, MC fainting was a result of his manipulating events to come."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The blank pages in MC's guide book would suggest as much, and make sense of much of what he said."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Sorry, care to explain that again?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Kicho's actions here are preventing the future as it occurs 500 years from now from happening as it should."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The history of this time as written in MC's guide book is being erased, and MC will die."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "What the?!"

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Meaning, what, if we don't prevent Kicho from having his way, MC's doomed?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "It's sounding that way."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Well..."
<p>No one really knew what to say.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "H-hey guys, I'm not dead yet! And Kicho sounded like he was speculating some."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Let's not throw me a funeral just yet."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Agreed. It is only Kicho's assumption that you will die."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will not allow that to happen."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I know you won't."
<p>I smiled, sharing in his confidence--
<p><strong>Vassal:</strong> "Pardon me, my lords!"
<p>(Hmm? That guy sounds pretty rushed.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Enter."
<p><strong>Vassal:</strong> "My lords, I apologize for interrupting council."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "What [is it]?"
<p><strong>Vassal:</strong> "We've received urgent news."
<p><strong>Vassal:</strong> "According to our scouts, the Mouri have raised an army!"
<p>(The Mouri?)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Against us? That's ridiculous. We just signed a peace treaty with them."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Also, who's supposed to rally them? Their clan head is long dead and they've got no one to replace him."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "As I recall it, their old vassals were barely keeping the region in one piece."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "But large sections of Chuugoku are lawless territory where the local daimyo do whatever they please."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Must be someone special if they can round that bunch up and get them to act like a unified force."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Who is leading them?"
<p><strong>Vassal:</strong> "Well... my lords..."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "You need not fear mockery or disbelief. Just tell us who."
<p><strong>Vassal:</strong> "All right..."
<p><strong>Vassal:</strong> "They say it's Motonari Mouri himself, back from hell to lead them."
<p>(He's back from the dead?)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "How very interesting..."
<p>......
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Give me your thoughts, Shingen."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Hmm..."
<p>In Kasugayama, Nobunaga's two great rivals held similar letters.
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "A letter of greeting from the dead Motonari Mouri? ...I'd hope it's faked, except that would be worse."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "His writing style and seal are authentic."
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "Should a room full of ghosts really be questioning the existence of another?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "A one, a two, a threeeeee... Altogether, that puts us at 50% ghost proliferation."
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "Yeah, you're right."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "I know we've got Kenshin and Yoshimoto... who's the third ghost?"
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "You, my lord! You're the third ghost! Don't make me call a priest on you..."
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "By the way, what did Motonari's ghost write?"
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Let me try and summarize..."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Ah-ahem. 'You're all too slow, so now I'm gonna be the one to kill Nobunaga.'"
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "That's somewhat harsh."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "In fairness, he wrote that he was ready to join hands with us, if that was something we wanted."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Obviously his goal is to bait us with the threat of stealing our vengeance out from under us."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "My letter says the same."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Along with the words '...can't believe the so-called God of War would want to sleep on a battle like this.'"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "The last part was wholly unnecessary."
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "I don't think anything's unnecessary or unplanned coming from the 'God of Deceit'."
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "...Assuming it really is him. In which case, his alliance is probably a lie too."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "I'd say the worst part is how tempting he makes it sound in spite of that."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Lord Kenshin, what will you do?"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "I've got no reason to stay out of a war, especially one as big as this."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Wait, my lord."

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "You don't think I should go, Kanetsugu?"
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Well now, it's pretty rare for Kanetsugu to not hand over everything you want."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "...Which means he must have a good reason. Tell me what it is?"
<p><strong>Kentsugu:</strong> "I, together with the Nokizaru, have been investigating that arms dealer."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "In addition to tying him to the pirates attacking Kicho's vessels, we've tied him to one other person--"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "...Motonari Mouri, who is acting as leader of those very pirates."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Why did you wait until now to say so?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "I needed proof. I had a feeling if Motonari was alive and part of this, he'd make his presence known."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "And then he sends these letters."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Lord Kenshin, I assume you can piece together the rest?"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "...Kicho and Motonari are in league together."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Why should that stop me from participating in their war?"
<p>Kenshin's cool tone was challenging.
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Recently, we've had our own domestic trouble with rebellious activity in Echigo. I can't imagine it's not related."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "In other words, they don't see sides. They want conflict in any and every form. Regardless of where it occurs."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "I can't imagine they want this, or any war, to end."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Should we ally with them and take down Nobunaga, we will become their next target."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Taking up their offer isn't a good idea."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Then what? Give up on killing Nobunaga and hunt down the arms merchants instead?"
<p>Kenshin wore a thin smile. Kanetsugu closed his eyes.
<p>When he opened them, they bore a look of resolve.
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "I would suggest--"
<p>......
<p>It was dawn of the day after we received the news of Motonari's return.
<p><strong>Oda Vassal 1:</strong> "We need more men to carry the timber!"
<p><strong>Oda Vassal 1:</strong> "Orders from Lord Mitsunari on the distribution of provisions. Pass it around!"
<p>(Things haven't slowed down once...)
<p>We had the upcoming war with the Mouri, the hunt for Kicho, and of course a major bridge to repair.
<p>And we were doing all three at once.
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "What do you think you're doing?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ieyasu. Keiji. Well, sewing is part of repairs and some of this stuff needs stitching up."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You're awfully hard working when you're supposed to be coming apart at the seams yourself. Literally."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Shouldn't you be with Lord Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah. He said as much himself..."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You may collapse again at any time."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Stay in my sight."
<p>Or so he'd sternly declared to me as soon as I woke up this morning.
<p>(I'm always happy he cares about me--)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I appreciate what you're trying to do, Nobunaga, but--"

<ul>
    <li>"I could be helping."</li>
    <li><strong>"I don't want to wait."</strong></li>
    <li>"I won't get exhausted."</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Even if something happens and I start to feel ill again, I don't want to sit around waiting for that."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I would feel a lot better working and helping out until it happens."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You have recovered too fast, I fear."
<p>(I don't know, you seem pretty happy about it.)
<p>He sighed, but I spied a smile through all that exasperation.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I thought collapsing had made you somewhat more docile."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Did you prefer me that way?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "No."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I prefer you exactly the way you are."
<p>Nobunaga drew me in close, his lips brushing across my brow.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You must return to me by nightfall."

<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You must return to me by nightfall."
<p>Nobunaga saw me off with a particularly tender smile.
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...But since I'm not sick and not under attack, I might as well do what I can."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "I mean, I believe it. I'm sure Nobunaga's used to that 'won't stay put' attitude of yours. He probably likes it."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "How HAVE you been feeling after that, MC?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Pretty good, really."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Well, don't stress yourself."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Don't bother. She won't listen."
<p>Ieyasu and Keiji waved goodbye and headed off their separate directions.
<p>(...I can TOO not stress myself! Just watch me!)
<p>......
<p>After parting with MC...
<p>Keiji said goodbye to Ieyasu as well and headed to check on the soldiers' training.
<p>A voice called out to him from the shadows.
<p><strong>Ninja:</strong> "Master Jisei."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Hello there."
<p><strong>Ninja:</strong> "A letter for you."
<p><strong>Ninja:</strong> "That is all."
<p>The man disappeared after handing the letter off to him.
<p>A crease formed in Keiji's brow as he scanned the contents.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Ah, of course."
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You should know I'd been considering how to punish you if you did not return tonight."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's what you spent the day doing?"
<p>I'd made it back before sundown, just like he'd wanted.
<p>It didn't stop him from admitting to me what he'd just said.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Is punishment really the healthiest thing for a girl who may or may not be dying?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Scolding you properly for leaving my side is important."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Well then, I'm glad I came back in time for my scolding."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You must do the same tomorrow. Make sure you come back promptly."
<p>(Ooh, that's a serious look!)
<p>Well, it was more the adorable look of an innocent yet spoiled child who was worried he wasn't going to get his way.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Don't worry. I'll come back to you tomorrow too."
<p>(I saw how lost you became when I passed out for just half a day.)
<p>(I would never leave you to that again.)
<p>...Nor would I admit it to him, as Nobunaga would probably hate to have his weakness pointed out.
<p>I kept those thoughts private as I drifted off hin his arms.
<p>......
<p>The next morning...
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hmm?"
<p>Nobunaga woke to the morning sun shining on his face. He turned to look at the warm body resting in his arms.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC. Wake up."
<p>Though he called her, she made no movement.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC? ...MC?!"
<p>Not even when he shook her did she stir.
<p>Her eyes closed, MC remained asleep in his arms...
