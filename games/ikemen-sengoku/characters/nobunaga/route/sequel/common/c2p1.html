  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 2 (1-5)</h1>

<h2>Part 1</h2>
<p>Wary of the sudden gunshot, Mitsunari and I exited camp.
<p>(Just what is going on?!)
<p>There was more fire, and we followed each thunderous crack through the empty field.
<p>(The shouts are getting louder...!)
<p>Finally, two groups engaged in a skirmish came into sight.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "...Those are..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "There were enemies outside the castle?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "No, it is worse than that. I believe we have a traitor in our midst."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What?!"
<p>(A trailtor?!)
<p>At the next ringing exchange, Mitsunari shut his eyes as if to judge the sound.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Both are Oda soldiers."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "One group seeks to destroy the rear guard and attack Lord Nobunaga from behind while he is engaged with the castle."
<p>(No!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "We have to let Nobunaga know!"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I will inform him. MC, you must hide yourself."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "The sound of their weapons... it's unlike anything I've heard before."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Those are not standard matchlock arquebuses. In which case, it could be beyond my skill to protect you."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...All right. I'll stay hidden."
<p>The brush around the campground was tall. I curled up so as to stay unseen.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Do not break cover, no matter what."
<p>At my acquiescence, Mitsunari ran in the direction of Nobunaga and the castle.
<p>(Traitors, this close to us...)
<p>We'd all been riding together not very long ago, yet I'd clearly beheld them killing their aliles... The sight left me chilled...
<p><strong>Wounded Soldier:</strong> "U-ugh... L-Lord Nobunaga..."
<p>(Oh no...)
<p>A brief distance away from my hiding spot, I saw a wounded soldier crawling through the grass.
<p>(He's trying to get back to camp to warn Nobunaga. But he'll die if he keeps pushing himself like that...!)
<p>I nearly started at the sight of him, forgetting my need to stay hidden.
<p>(If only he knew that Mitsunari had already gone to inform Nobunaga...!)
<p>(...But I'd be alerting our enemies to my position if I told him that...)
<p>Two choices battled in my mind; my tightly clenched hands were cold and sweaty.
<p>The soldier didn't notice me. But I noticed the trail of blood his wound was leaving.
<p>(...Dammit! I can't! I can't just sit back and do nothing while someone might die!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You! Hey!"
<p><strong>Shouting Soldiers:</strong> "...Nobunaga's Princess is in the main camp! Find her!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Uh oh..."
<p>Not a momemt after I broke cover, I heard the shouts of the traitors looking for me.
<p>(Gotta be quick!)
<p><strong>Wounded Soldier:</strong> "A-are you the...?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mitsunari's gone to inform Lord Nobunaga of the situation! What you need is to conserve your strength!"
<p>I helped ease the man into my hiding spot.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Over here, where it's--"
<p><strong>Oda Traitor:</strong> "Found you!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Holy Cats...!"
<p>One of the traitors had caught up to us, too quickly. I saw him draw his blade.
<p>(...Better than shooting me on sight! Not that things aren't looking bad though!)
<p><strong>Wounded Soldier:</strong> "P-Princess, leave me and run...!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I can't!"
<p><strong>Oda Traitor:</strong> "Don't worry! I'll make sure Nobunaga gets your pretty head back at least!"
<p>(What do I do?!)
<p>It was just me and one wounded soldier, and nothing at our disposal. Suddenly--
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "See to your own head."

<h2>Part 2</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "See to your own head."
<p>A dark figure astride a horse of black, both limned in the light of the moon, appeared.
<p><strong>Oda Traitor:</strong> "Grah!"
<p>The traitor fell, his sword still lifted high in the air.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga!"
<p>As I got a better look at him, I saw splashes of dark red on his armor. Blood from the battle he'd just returned from.
<p><strong>Wounded Soldier:</strong> "My... Lord... I'm so sorry..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Apologies do nothing. If you wish to atone, then recover quickly."
<p><strong>Wounded Soldier:</strong> "Yes, my lord..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, stay here. Keiji's unit will be arriving shortly."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will deal with these traitors."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Wait--"
<p>Nobunaga spurred his horse on, not waiting for my response.
<p>He had not arrived alone, several soldiers following after him.
<p>(Nobunaga, your eyes...)
<p>Though I'd only gotten a momentary glimpse of them, I knew they'd gone cold.
<p>I was shaking, and it wasn't just from fear.
<p>More than the danger we faced, I worried if I could truly keep Nobunaga from sliping away from me?
<p>......
<p>Nobunaga took care of both the traitorous daimyo who turned on us and the traitors in our midst in one fell swoop.
<p>(...It still bothers me... How could they turn on their allies like this?)
<p>I looked upon the casualties of tonight's gruesome battle in a daze before searching the camp for that familiar black armor.
<p>(Where is Nobunaga now...?)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Buck up, guys!"
<p>One lively voice had the power to cut through the solemn curtains hanging over the gloomy evening.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "It's hard to tell who's injured when you're all moping around."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Youre right... Sorry..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Don't apologize. Hey, we're all just happy to be alive, aren't we? Here's some water."
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Thank you, Lord Keiji..."
<p>After helping the exhausted, disheartened soldiers, Keiji came to see me.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey, MC. You hanging in there?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I, uh..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Take your time."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Right... Um, Keiji, where's Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I need to be with him. He's..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Whatever he needs, if he sees you looking pale as a ghost, you're going to shock him more than anything."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "In these situations, take care of yourself first. The rest of us will be okay."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But this is exactly the kind of situation where he needs me."
<p>(His eyes...)
<p>(He's hurting. Even if he doesn't realize it, this betrayal is hurting him badly.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I promised to be there for him when things are at their worst."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Don't tell me you don't go out of your way for others when they're having a bad time?
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Ah..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Well, I'm a special case!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "As for LOrd Nobunaga, he and Hideyoshi were interrogating one of the traitors."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I guess the guys who did it were vassals that had their former lord and most of his clan executed by Lord Nobunaga."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...This was revenge..."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Sounds like it."
<p>(I can only imagine how hard it would be [to] forgive someone for that. If you ever could... And they obviously couldn't...)
<p>(What I don't get is how they pretended to smile, drink, and laugh with us while they had this lurking in their hearts?)
<p>Hatred that ran so deep it went unknown until it struck with spine-chilling intensity.
<p>(Kennyo hated Nobunaga so much for what he did. But he is just one of many who can never forgive him...)
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "That said, they should both be back now."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Thanks, I'll go looking for them."
<p>I ran back to camp, needing more than anything to see Nobunaga right now.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Nobunaga!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC...?"

<h2>Part 3</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC...?"
<p>I found Nobunaga; he was just finished cleaning his sword.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Hmph. Both the insurrectionists and the traitors proved quite weak."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Whatever foolish idea came into their minds that let them think they stood a chance against me?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Whoever the mastermind is, he must be excellent at inflating egos."
<p>My heart began to scream at the calm in his expression when he spoke.
<p>(It's not just his eyes... Everything about him feels cold...)
<p>I was sad to see him regress to that state after how warm and caring he'd become.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga..."
<p>I leapt into his arms and held him tight.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Were you frightened?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No..."
<p>I was choked up at the way he held me to comfort me.
<p>(Not about the battle.)
<p>(I'm frightened about how kind you are, despite the hated acts you commit.)
<p>(I'm frightened that one day I won't be able to bring you back.)
<p>Nobunaga Oda, the Devil King of the Sixth Heaven. Despised by his enemies. Feared by many of his followers.
<p>A ruthless conqueror and killer who would kill even his own heart to bring peace.
<p>I loved him in spite of all that he had done and would continue to do.
<p>(Even if that leads us to situations like this.)
<p>(All we can do is accept it.)
<p>(Meanwhile, I keep what remains of his broken heart intact in my own.)
<p>This burden was ours to bear. His devotion to his cause, and my devotion to him, would be tested countless times.
<p>(...It'll be all right though.)
<p>(I will be strong for you.)
<p>But right now, I needd something to lift this heavy unease around us.
<p>(...I need to change the subject. Something to help him forget the pain. Maybe a story about my time?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hey. Have I ever told you about movies?"
<p>I looked up at him, a smile on my face.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...No. What is a 'moo'... a 'movee?'"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's like a visual storybook that you watch unfold before you. With action and characters..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...You follow along with them, sharing in their joy, sympathizing with their sadness..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "So, like a picture scroll?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah. Only there's sound and pictures 'scroll by' on their own. And you can see them in a big theater."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "There they've got seats lined up and snacks like popcorn... which is made by heating corn kernels until they puff up."
<p>(Argh, of all things to talk about, why did I choose movies? Because now--)
<p>...Now I was super hungry for popcorn!
<p>My stomach noisily agreed.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Er..."
<p>(There's no use saying "Please ignore that.")
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I wondered what you were going on about."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you are hungry, then say so."

<ul>
    <li>(I'm embarrassed.)</li>
    <li>"You heard that?"</li>
    <li><strong>"I'm not!"</strong></li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I-I'm not saying I'm hungry! T-that was an automatic response! I..."
<p>I said whatever I could to lessen some of this fiery heat in my cheeks, but when I shyly looked up at Nobunaga...
<p>(Aww...)
<p>He was less mocking than I expected, looking at me with a tender smile.
<p>(Well, it mad him smile, so the embarrassment was worth it.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "How very amusing that you celebrate my victory with a demand for food."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But I just said--!"
<p>(Never mind. I don't forgive you for the pretty smile after [all]!!!)
<p>I followed a laughing Nobunaga out, still hoping to restore my dignity, when--
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobu-ack!"

<h2>Part 4</h2>
<p>I'd been following right behind Nobunaga.
<p>...Which also meant I bumped into him when he came to a sudden stop.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "W-what is it?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Hmm."
<p>He was staring into a copse of trees.
<p>(Is something there?)
<p>I didn't see anything myself.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is nothing. Let us go."
<p>He began moving again, not looking back.
<p>......
<p>Though we put down the rebellion, we had lost more manpower than anticipated and returned to Azuchi in a somber mood.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Their firearms are smaller than tanegashima rifles, you say?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Yeah."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Only a small number of them turned traitor. It was the surprising effectiveness of their weapons--"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...plus the surprise attack that led to such a large amount of casualties."
<p>To Nobunaga's left and right, Mitsuhide and Hideyoshi discussed the latest battle.
<p>(There were so many gunshots, it reminded me more of revolvers than slow loading matchlock rifles.)
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We were lucky they didn't slaughter the entire rear guard, as that was apparently their goal..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...That's where the wounded are. Who would do that...? To their allies...?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Once they set their mind on revenge, they might have been looking for an especially brutal target."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "What would you do, Hideyoshi, if you knew the man who murdered your lord not only lived but prospered from his death?"
<p>Hideyoshi lowered his eyes, a barely audible growl of pain leaving his lips.
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Hatred is nothing more than the reverse of love. The greater the one grows, the greater its twin becomes."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "The cruelest acts, those defying both morals and logic, are always motivated by a form of strong love."
<p>(...Because they lost someone they love?)
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I'm simply relieved you're safe, MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm sorry I broke cover after you told me to stay put, Mitsunari."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Not at all. It was very noble of you, and I would like to believe I'd have done the same in your situation."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I'm the one who should apologize for not noticing the betrayal sooner."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That wasn't your fault, Mitsunari!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Mitsuhide, how goes the investigation into Kicho's ties with the insurrection?"
<p>(Right, I never did get around to asking about Kicho after that first day.)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "The weapons we've come up against are indeed imported from oversease and were recently distributed to your enemies."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "We've got reports that Ieyasu and Masamune are struggling against the same kind of firepower."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "We know they did, at some point, pass through Kicho's merchant house in Sakai, however--"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "...We cannot determine that Kicho was responsible for their sale or distribution."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I recall the testimony of that man we captured. He said they bought their weapons from pirates."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Yes, my lord. That, coupled with the confirmed reports of various merchant vessels suffering pirate attacks--"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "...would lead one to assume the pirates are the ones furnishing our enemies."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Unless Kicho hired the pirates to make it seem as if the merchandise was stolen."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I consider that most likely."
<p>(So, now we know that Kicho's gone so far as to shake hands with pirates in his campaign against Nobunaga.)
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Whoever is responsible, they are empowering our lord's enemies while staying out of the direct conflict."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "It reminds me of the mastermind behind Kennyo's escape."
<p>(That's right. We never learned who freed him and assisted Ranmaru in capturing me.)
<p>......
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Do we have any idea who it could be?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Not at present. However--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If he wishes to take my head, I expect he'll show himself again."
<p>......
<p>(If that was Kicho, he's shown he'll go to extreme lengths to get Nobunaga killed.)
<p>After a moment of thought, Nobunaga cast his gaze outward, toward some distant sight.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We shall hear his motives from the man himself."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Oh, hey! You're thinking--?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes. I shall go to Sakai to see Kicho."
<p>(Meet with the man who's quite likely attempted to assasinate you three plus X number of times?!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "See that Azuchi will be well-defended in my absence. I leave in several days."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide and Hideyoshi:</strong> "Yes, my lord."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "That's more like it! Get Kicho to answer this mystery for us!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You come too, Keiji."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Sure thing!
<p>They exited the audience hall to prepare."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga, who is Kicho? How do you and he know each other?"
<p>Nobunaga:</strong> "Kicho was... a vassal of mine."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh?"

<h2>Part 5</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga, who is Kicho? How do you and he know each other?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Kicho was... a vassal of mine."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is a complicated story, but a man named Dosan Saito would send Kicho to me as a hostage to secure peace."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I had little need for one, and when I found we shared the same ambition, I took him on as a personal retainer."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "He disappeared suddenly after the destruction of Ishiyama Hongan-ji."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I had no word of his activities until he appeared as a merchant in Sakai."
<p>(A former vassal? And a close one, at that.)
<p>(...So Kicho betrayed him. Broke his heart.)
<p>And what would happen when we went to Sakai and saw Kicho for ourselves? What damage would that do to Nobunaga?
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What are you looking sad for?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Me? Sad? Ohh no!"
<p>(I can't make him feel bad for ME when I'm over here feeling bad for him!)
<p>I dug up a quick smile for him, but he seemed to see through my hasty reaction.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Wait for me in my room."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What are we doing?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You will attempt to win your body back from me in a game of Go."
<p>(We're really playing Strip Go again?!)
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You can always challenge me back if you wish to reclai your body."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Is that so...?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Consider the bet on!"
<p>......
<p>(He took my challenge seriously!)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you win, I will return the parts of your body I have claimed to you."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And if I lose? ...Not saying I will."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you lose this time I shall... Yes, I think I shall claim your voice."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And what will you do with that?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will have you speak the words I command."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's enough for you?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes."
<p>(I don't know. It sounds like I'm getting off so light here that he's got me worried.)
<p>(But I've been itching to have a Go rematch, and it'll be great to take my mind off things, even for a short while.)
<p>Just the thought of us, alone, sharing in that private game of wits had my heart racing with excitement.
<p>(I used to spend that time desperate to defend myself against him.)
<p>(...Now I think back on all those games as happy memories.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Got it."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Good. I have a few things to finish up first. You may wait for me in my room."
<p>I smiled and nodded; Nobunaga returnd my smile and left.
<p>(I wonder if he brought up the game to cheer me up?)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "You do not know the value of what you are trading away."
<p>Mitsuhide looked at me in amusement.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What do you mean?"
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Words have power."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "They are impossible to take back."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "And you have no idea what he will make you promise."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, what's the worst he could do? Make me say something embarrassing out loud?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's not like he'd make me promise anything... too bad... right?"
<p>(...Right?)
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "I suppose if you win, then there's nothing to fear, now is there?"
<p>......
<p>Speaking of words and their power, I couldn't help but think Mitsuhide must have cast a curse on me, as later that day--
<p>(...Argh, no! I'm losing! What's the best response here?! Is there even one?)
<p>As far as I could see, I was cornered in my game with Nobunaga, and without any hope of a comeback either.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Your skills have atrophied."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...No arguments there..."
<p>(I used to be so good at this game too!)
<p>(...Not good enough to beat Nobunaga. Ever. But he's last boss level tough...)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do you realize your foolishness now?"
<p>Nobunaga quirked a brow, a devilish smile on his face.
<p>He pushed the Go board away, leaning in to stroke my ear in the same movement.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "However, it is too late for regrets."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ah..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Now then--"
<p>Though Nobunaga's touch was tender, his fingers reminded me of talons, holding me, his prey captive.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mm..."
<p>I was already moaning as he lifted my chin up, my body quick to remember the pleasure he could draw from me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What shall I demand of your voice?"

    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Now then--"
    <p>Though Nobunaga's touch was tender, his fingers reminded me of talons, holding me, his prey captive.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mm..."
    <p>I was already moaning as he lifted my chin up, my body quick to remember the pleasure he could draw from me.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What shall I demand of your voice?"
    <p>He brushed my lip with his thumb.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "You didn't hav something in mind...?"
    <p>Even that light touch sent tingles of pleasure down my spine.
    <p>He seemed aware of that, smiling.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Not in particular."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Really?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I thought I could find the most value in claiming your voice."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I can make you agree to any promise I wish, after all."
    <p>(Mitsuhide called it!)
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nothing too weird though, right?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I am thinking."
    <p>He sighed, and at this close distance, I could feel his breath on my lips.
    <p>Everything about him was so seductive, even waiting for him to make a move left me reeling with a kind of euphoria.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I know what I want you to say."
    <p>His dark pupils grew as they fixed on mine.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Say, 'I lost to you on purpose.'"
    <p>At last, he revealed his request, and I had to say, I was a bit confused.
    <p>(That's all?)
    <p>Still, as his thumb encouraged my lips to part, I spoke the words he asked of me.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I lost to you... on purpose."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Did you now?"
    <p>He laughed suddenly, slinging an arm around me and drawing me in close.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Ah!"
    <p>Nobunaga nibbled sweetly on my ear, drawing a series of broken cries from me.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "That must mean you never had any intention of taking your body back..."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ahhh... Nobu...naga!"
    <p>He didn't stop at just my ear. Like on our forced march, his hands sought each of his former conquests.
    <p>Not forcefully, just enough to remind me what it had been like the first time, and to make me want more.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Here... and here... and here. It seems as if you wanted me to hold possession over them..."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I... only said what you told me to..."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Is that true?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "After all our previous games, such a wretched loss had to have been calculated."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I just f-forgot...ahh...!"
    <p>I tried to admit the truth, but my body was too busy indulging in his affections to spare me room to speak.
    <p>Nobunaga's fingers had just begun to peel back my kimono from my flesh, but already, I felt bared to him.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I would never... lose on purpose."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You don't sound very convincing."
    <p>He was enjoying this, and I encouraged him, slipping down to the floor in his arms.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Perhaps a masochistic streak lies beneath that strong will of yours?"
    <p>(For you? ...Maybe!)
    <p>But he was teasing right now, and I wouldn't have that, not without a fight.
    <p>My glare only amused him more.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I won't lose again, you know!"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then I shall only have to grow stronger to conquer you."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Oh, please... do..."
    <p>He kissed me, displaying all the strength at his command in the way his fingers massaged my back and shoulders.
    <p>......
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...You were really teasing tonight."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Oh?"
    <p>In the end, he'd used his victory just to have me confess to a loss I hadn't intended. All to have his way with me.
    <p>By the time he finished reminding my body who knew how to treat it best, the sun had gone down.
    <p>(I promise I didn't lose on purpose...)
    <p>(...But even if I'd won, you can keep possession of my body.)
    <p>(I like what you do with it, after all.)
    <p>Lo and behold, he'd basically gotten that confession out of me with his command. That clever, sexy devil.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Like... really evil."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I do not understand your definition."
    <p>I leaned my head on his chest while he gently combed his fingers through my hair.
    <p>(No surprise it's confusing. Because I love you when you're this kind of evil.)
    <p>Happiness suffused me, and I smiled.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Keep the way you are."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "What way?"
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Looking pleased. It puts me at unease to see you otherwise."
    <p>(Oh, Nobunaga...)
    <p>It seemed I was right about the reason he challenged me to the game.
    <p>He just wanted to cheer me up. That brought another welcome surge of joy.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm happy to hear that."
    <p>I slowly stood up.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Where are you going?"
    <p>Nobunaga reached to take my hand.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will not allow you to leave."
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "Haha! I'm not going anywhere far!"
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's just it's nearly dinner time.
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "I don't want everyone to see me naked when food arrives."
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I see."
    <p>I smiled down at him, and he relented to free my captive hand.
    <p>(Between this and the way he loves to tease me, Nobunaga really has this surprisingly boyish side to him.)
    <p>How happy he mad me.
    <p>I grabbed my kimono and was in the midst of tying my sash on when--
    <p><strong>MC:</strong> "...H-huh...?"
    <p>My world was spinning.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC?"
    <p>(I'm... dizzy. Could be... vertigo?)
    <p>(...My ears are buzzing too. And my head... hurts.)
    <p>My legs turned to gelatin; I couldn't stay standing any longer.
    <p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC? MC!"
    <p>I fell to my knees, seeking solace from the painful buzzing in my head, but it only grew louder.
    <p>(N-Nobunaga...)
    <p>I tried to turn around to reach for him, but before I could, I passed out.
