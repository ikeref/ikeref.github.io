  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 4 (6-10)</h1>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not ask me anything. Just... let us feel each other in this moment."
<p>When I looked into Nobunaga's eyes, they were no longer wavering.
<p>...They were scintillating.
<p>(If this is helping to protect your heart, then my answer is--)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yes... of course..."
<p>At my assent, Nobunaga withdrew his fingers and entered me fully.
<p>My vision was flooded with sparks, yet I fought to keep my eyes open as pleasure rolled up upon me like a wave.
<p>I didn't want to miss that look of release on his face, when peace came over him at last.
<p>...However, that night, I did not see it.
<p>......
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You want to order the withdrawal of our forces engaged in putting down the rebellions?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Well, that's certainly a plan..."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Is it?"
<p>MC fell into a restful sleep in Nobunaga's arms that night.
<p>Afterward, Nobunaga summoned his warlords to the audience hall for council.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "All of our strength must be put toward fighting the Mouri."
<p>His closest associates would say he'd lightened up some since meeting MC. But tonight, there was no trace of that.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "We would be giving up a sizeable amount of territory to do so--if only on a temporary basis."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Is this decision made on the understanding that our enemies will strike us while our numbers are at their lowest?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yes, if you like."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Holding our outermost territories will be meaningless if our main force is defeated."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And those warlords capable of leading an army will gather to join the Mouri's cause."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We will defeat all of them in one swoop."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "And that should restore your authority and put an end to this whole mess?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "...Don't forget our enemy is armed with weapons we don't know that much about."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "It's gonna be a risky gamble."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "If the Oda lose, this land will be thrust back into a period of violent, petty fighting."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "But if we win, we'll be closer to unification than ever before."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Which means this is a battle we've got to win. At any costs."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "Why, Hideyoshi, are you saying there were battles you thought to lose?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Not a one."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "I like the way this is coming together."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You'll be needing a star on this big stage of yours, and Keiji Maeda's your guy!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Once we crush Kicho's ambitions, MC will be safe too, right?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga, about that--"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Yes. How is MC doing?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "She woke up not long ago."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I see, she... Err, she what?!"

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga, about that--"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Yes. How is MC doing?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "She woke up not long ago."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I see, she... Err, she what?!"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "She woke up?"
<p>The newes spread through the room.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "For real?! She's--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You may all see her for yourselves tomorrow morning, if you wish."
<p>Everyone immediately relaxed.
<p>Nobunaga smiled when he saw it.
<p>It was a smile confident in their victory.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We have our goddess of victory back."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I expect you all not to disappoint her."
<p><strong>All:</strong> "Yes, my lord!"
<p>......
<p>The next day...
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ugh... How do I still feel this bad?"
<p>I'd gotten up, albeit slowly, and gotten dressed for the day.
<p>I ate breakfast--carried in by a vassal who looked half-surprised and half-ready to cry--and was just wondering what to do.
<p>(I can't believe I slept in after all that. How much sleep does my dumb body need?)
<p>(I didn't get to ask what was up with Nobunaga. Maybe the warlords know?)
<p>(I tried asking the guy who brought breakfast, but he'd been given the hush order. For some reason.)
<p>"We are not to say anything our lord has not already spoken of," was [the response I got].
<p>(I need to pin down Hideyoshi or something. Assuming he's not too busy...)
<p>Just as I was about to leave the room--
<p>I heard what sounded like a stampede coming down the hallway.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...What the?"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "MC!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hey gu-yikes?!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Y-you're awake! You're really awake!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I mean, Lord Nobunaga wouldn't lie, but--!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You okay, MC?! You hurt anywhere?!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Um... I'm a little surprised, maybe!"
<p>My ears still rang with the rattling of the screen door when the guys threw it open. Past Hideyoshi and Keiji, I saw the others.
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Keiji, could you maybe try not shaking the sick person?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "You're still pale. Have they let you eat anything today?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "We're all just so relieved to see you up and about, MC!"
<p>Something was wrong. I felt it in my bones.
<p>("Sick person?" "Let me eat?" "Up and about?")
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...What's everyone talking about?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I slept in half the day, but it's not like I passed out again."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...Lord Nobunaga didn't tell you?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Tell me what?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "It's been four days."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Four days since what?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...No. You've been asleep for four days."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "W-what?"
<p>(Four days...? N-no way...)
<p>I couldn't speak. I looked around at everyone, waiting for some tell.
<p>There was none.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "T-this isn't a joke, right?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Why would we lie about this?"
<p>(Is that why my body was so heavy...?)
<p>(...And if I'd been passed out for four days, that would explain Nobunaga's reaction.)

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p>(Is that why my body was so heavy...?)
<p>(...And if I'd been passed out for four days, that would explain Nobunaga's reaction.)
<p>That broken-hearted look on his face...
<p>(But if that's the case, why didn't he tell me when I woke up?)
<p>(He didn't want to worry me? No, I think he had some other reason...)
<p>(...Like something happened while I was asleep that he's too afraid to talk about.)
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Mc, you still with us?"
<p>Masamune brought me back to reality.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah. Sorry for spooking everyone."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Do you have a headache still? That was one of your symptoms last time..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No pain right now. Hey, what happened with the war? Has it started yet?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Not yet. We will be starting shortly."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "We are withdrawing our scattered troops from the borders at present."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "In addition, we are having them return with any of the enemy's armaments they were able to secure--"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "...Such that we might train our own troops in their usage for the upcoming battle."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Good to know... And how has Nobunaga been holding up these past four days?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "He spent every spare moment with you."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Outside of that, he's been like the rest of us. Busy in councils, preparing for battle."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Anything else?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Is there something on your mind?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I haven't noticed anything unusual around here. Just your being asleep."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Huh..."
<p>Keiji grew silent almost as soon as I did.
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "The last bit of news is that Kicho's still on the loose. Though we finally finished repairing the bridge yesterday."
<p>(Kicho...)
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If we take what Kicho told us, as long as I can kill him and achieve my goal--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...your future will arrive as it should, and you will continue to live."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Nothing has changed."
<p>......
<p>(It seems like Nobunaga's been doing what he said he would these last four days.)
<p>(It's no different than what he promised me. So why do I feel so nervous?)
<p>His attitude. Memories of it twisted around my heart like thorns and crowded my throat.
<p>An ocean's worth of bad feelings rose up to consume me, but I smiled in spite of them.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thanks, everyone. If there's anything you need my help with, let me know, okay?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "You need to get your head on straight, lass!"
<p>Masamune gave me a very gentle bop.
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "No one jumps right into work after four days of unconsciousness."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...I can't believe Masamune scolded you before I could. And he's right, too."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "The really tragic thing is that if this were him, we'd have to knock him back out again to keep him in bed."
<p><strong>Masasmune:</strong> "Come now, I'd never put someone in the lass's state to work!"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Regardless, we all hope you'll spend today relaxing, MC."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "We've been quite worried about you."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "No one wants to stay put when they're sick, so you've got my sympathies."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "But you'll be doing us and Lord Nobunaga a favor by doing so."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'll try. Thanks, guys."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "How about a walk in the garden, just to keep your strength up?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...That's not a bad idea, coming from you. And if anything goes wrong, someone's going to find her before too long."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's a nice suggestion. I'll try it."

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p>The warlords left, promising to visit again whenever they were able.
<p>Meanwhile, I took a walk in the palace gardens to get a feel for how my body was holding up after four days.
<p>(If I'd passed out like this in the present, I'd be hearing a lot more than just "We were worried about you!")
<p>(Of course, if I were in the present, none of this disappearing timelines stuff would even be an issue.)
<p>Four days. It didn't seem like too long until it was taken away from you without warning.
<p>(...I really hate how powerless I feel.)

<ul>
    <li>("Just a cold.")</li>
    <li><strong>(I wanna punch Kicho.)</strong></li>
    <li>(It's just like he said.)</li>
</ul>

<p>(God, I only wish exercise and healthy meals would give me the power to get better. Or maybe punch out Kicho...!)
<p>(Huh. Exercise WOULD be good for that, actually. Okay, let's move my body!)
<p>(...I've got to be in shape so I can stand beside Nobunaga when he kicks Kicho's butt and brings peace to the land!)
<p><strong>???:</strong> "...Lady MC...?"
<p>It sounded almost like a whisper. A voice from the shadows of the foliage.
<p>(That voice. Is that--?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Ran...maru?"
<p>I responded softly. Cautiously, Ranmaru stuck his head out. He looked around and, seeing no one, stepped out into the light.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Yeah, it's me. Hi, Lady MC."
<p>(Ranmaru, it's really you!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You're safe! Thank goodness."
<p>I seemed to have flustered him.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...Heh, I'm a little surprised that YOU're safe given how happy you are to see an enemy ninja sneak into your castle!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, right. I forgot about that whole 'betrayed Nobunaga and the Oda' thing."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "How could you forget the most important part! I was sure you were going to scream 'Intruder!' when you saw me!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I would never do that."
<p>The last time I saw Ranmaru was the night Nobunaga and Kennyo dueled, where Nobunaga injured Kennyo gravely.
<p>It was thanks to Ranmaru I began to understand Kennyo and Ranmaru's cause better. I couldn't see him as an enemy.
<p>......
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...I wish I could be like you, but I really can't."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I would do anything if the person I loved asked it of me."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Except that night... I couldn't. And I can't tell whether I did the right thing or not. I still don't know what's right..."
<p>......
<p>Ranmaru suffered over his desire to support Kennyo, even though Kennyo's heart had been subsumed by vengeance.
<p>(Both of them are good people who've been destroyed by this awful conflict.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "By the way, how is Kennyo? Is he--?"
<p>I worried what answer I'd receive.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...He's alive. It was... really rough, but he finally recovered enough to get around on his own. Unfortunately, that's when--"
<p>Ranmaru stopped there.
<p>It was as if what happened next was almost too painful to say. I tried to be encouraging.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...When what happened?"
<p>Ranmaru shut his eyes, and I feared he'd tell me the worst.
<p>(Ranmaru...)
<p>But there was a look of resolve on his face.
<p>His eyes now shined with a clarity that even tears could not fog.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...Master Kennyo has decided to participate in the next war.

<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...Master Kennyo has decided to participate in the next war.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What? Weren't you saying he's just barely able to get around without support?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Yeah. Honestly, this is all because of that letter Motonari Mouri sent."
<p>(Motonari really was reaching out to any and every enemy of the Oda.)
<p>I was a little frightened by Motonari's resourcefulness, but I switched my attention back to Ranmaru.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Are you sure you should be telling me this? I don't want to be mean but... I have to tell Nobunaga and the others about this."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I know. That's why I came to see you."
<p>Ranmaru smiled, though it was hard to see how given what he said next.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "You see, Master Kennyo left me behind."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "He did what?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "He said I would get in his way; that I was conflicted about killing Nobunaga."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "It broke my heart when he left. But then I started thinking about it."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I don't think Nobunaga's death is what Master Kennyo truly wants."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Do you know what it is he wants?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master Kennyo always said it was a 'path of destruction' he walked."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Again and again, he told me I didn't have to come with him, but still, he allowed it."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Until this last time, when he told me no. That's why I've been thinking about why."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master Kennyo's tough. Way tougher than me. He taught me how to fight."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Which is why I wouldn't stand a chance at stopping him by force, even now."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "So that can't be why he left me. I think he was afraid I'd stop him another way."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "He was a kind man, but he's left all that aside to focus on Nobunaga. And I think... he's afraid his reolve is wavering."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "What Master Kennyo really wants is--"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...He doesn't want anyone else to lose the people important to them."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "He's trying to prevent another tragedy like what happened to us from ever occurring."
<p>(The tragedy of Hongan-ji...)
<p>I recalld what Ranmaru had told me.
<p>......
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga struggled with the Ikko Ikki for a long time. So, he decided to go after Master Kennyo, their leader."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...He set fire to this whole area. Burning down the temple... and my master's followers... He turned Hongan-ji to ash."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Master Kennyo was the nicest man I'd ever met. But his heart was lost in that fire. I see it, burning in the back of his eyes..."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "He swore to become a demon to get vengeance for all the souls who perished without knowing peace."
<p>......
<p>(Having his temple burned down around him. His followers killed...)
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga took everything from Master Kennyo. And that's something even I will never forget.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "But my master knows that killing him won't bring anything back."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "That's why I've come to believe there must be another way..."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "That there's some way to save Master Kennyo from all this hate and anger without taking Lord Nobunaga's life!"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I've decided to bring my master's kind heart back to the surface."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "...And I've got to keep him alive to do it."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ranmaru---"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "That's the long and short of why I'm here!"
<p>Ranmaru shot me a cutesy wink.
<p>(He's trying to stay positive, but--)
<p>(It's obvious how much he's suffering.)
<p>Left behind by someone he loves. Unaware if he'll ever see him again. And risking everything on one, last chance--
<p>My heart hurt when I thought of it.
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "Here, Lady MC."
<p>Ranmaru pulled out a letter and handed it to me.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What's this?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "This is what I've learnd about Master Kennyo's location so far. I'd like you to give this to Lord Nobunaga."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You're sure that's a good idea?"
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I'll do anything to stop Master Kennyo."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "But I can't do it alone."
<p><strong>Ranmaru:</strong> "I need your help. Please..."
