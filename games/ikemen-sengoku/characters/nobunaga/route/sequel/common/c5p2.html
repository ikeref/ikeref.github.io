  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 5 (6-10)</h1>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...I told him about the future."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "As many details about history following the Honno-ji incident as I could."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You gave him spoilers?!"
<p>I couldn't believe that Sasuke gave Nobunaga spoilers when he warned me not to! On the other hand--
<p>...The smartest man I knew from the present giving a history lecture to the smartest man in this time period?
<p>(Wow, I wish I got to sit in on that! ...Okay, brain, enough imaginings. Back to important stuff!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But why would you do that? Wouldn't that be bad for the timeline?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "He told me it would save your life."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Nobunaga wanted to know what he should and shouldn't change about the future."
<p>(All to save me?)
<p>(What is he thinking of changing--?)
<p>All the sudden, the dark imaginings I'd been having this week coalesced into one really, really bad idea.
<p>Sparked by Kicho's words...
<p>......
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Your survival at Honno-ji was nothing short of a miracle."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I fully believe you are the key to destroying the future."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "...Because you are the spark that keeps the flames of war burning."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "As long as you remain alive, the world you are seeking will never come to pass."
<p>......
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "I am going to put a stop to Japan's unification and keep the country at war."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "Thus, the future you were born in will cease to exist."
<p><strong>Kicho:</strong> "You'll die alongside your miserable world."
<p>......
<p>(Kicho implied Nobunaga's survival was the reason the Sengoku would continue.)
<p>(And if it did, history would change and I would die...)
<p>In other words, to bring about peace and an end to the war, Nobunaga needed to die.
<p>That was, in fact, how my timeline had come about. Unification following Nobunaga's death.
<p>(Then what if Nobunaga went to Sasuke to confirm if that was true?)
<p>My blood ran cold.
<p>(He couldn't really be thinking--?)
<p>(Except that Nobunaga was already prepared to sacrifice his heart and soul to achieveing his goals.)
<p>(But isn't that all the more reason he wouldn't give up all he's done and pass things off to another... for my sake?)
<p>(No, right...? He wouldn't! I can just imagine him saying, "Where is the point in such unsubstantiated, foolish--")
<p>That one word triggered a memory.
<p>"...No matter what foolish and dangerous thing I will do to save you..."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, god..."
<p>The sad look in his eyes when I awoke.
<p>His forcing me to stay here via the bet.
<p>It all clicked together. And I hated it.
<p>(...He's planning on dying?)
<p>Suddenly, my mind was clear.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sasuke, do you think you could sneak me out and get me to the battlefield?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...You truly wish to go?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Yeah. I have to see Nobunaga and... confirm something with him."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm kind of under guard right now, so if I do break out, they're going to chase us. Well? Does that make this a no go?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Not at all. Whether it's Azuchi Castle or World 8-4, I'm confident in my princess rescuing abilities."
<p>He stated that impassively but quickly, which filled me with confidence.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm impressed!"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I am a moderately awesome ninja you know."

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p>...It was the day after the Oda left Azuchi.
<p>While wary of surprise attacks on the way to battle, the army stopped at a small lake to rest the soldiers and the horses.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Mitsuhide, from this point on, you will proceed according to our plan."
<p><strong>Mitsuhide:</strong> "My lord... Good luck in battle."
<p>Mitsuhide bowed once and then exited into the shadows beyond the tent wall.
<p>Keiji arrived after him.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "More secret missions for Mitsuhide?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I assign work to those befitting. I am looking forward to your performance in tomorrow's battle."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Good, cause I won't let you down! You want a fighter? Keiji Maeda won't disappoint!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Though if I could ask one thing of you--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...It is about MC, yes?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Ah--!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am aware of your fondness for her."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "It's, uh..."
<p>Keiji scratched his head before finally looking up to meet his lord.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Why'd you leave her behind?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Why is that information important?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Only cause it made her sad."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Her emotions are her own problem."
<p>Keiji's mouth shot open--
<p>However, no words came out. Despite the cold cruelty of what Nobunaga had said--
<p>...Something about the calmness in his eyes hushed Keiji's complaints.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We cannot control others' minds. We can hardly control our own."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "but we can protect. And I will protect her."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Hey, uh--"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Sorry for, ya know, stepping out of line."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are forgiven."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Take your leave now and relax. I will need that brave spirit come the dawn."
<p>Nobunaga turned and walked out, his coat flowing behind him. Keiji watched him go.
<p>......
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Yo, everyone! Gettin' enough rest?"
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "Haha, we were until you showed up, Keiji! Just kidding! Lord Nobunaga gave us wine tonight so we're doing great!"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "We've got the biggest battle of our lives looming and our lord is as dignified and majestic as ever!"
<p><strong>Soldier 3:</strong> "Well, we only got this far because Lord Nobunaga's been leading us! Which is why we're gonna win this time too!"
<p><strong>Soldier 4:</strong> "Yeah, we gotta impress him! Maybe win some prestige for ourselves, too?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Just don't let your ambition go without your weapons or your head may go rolling off without your body!"
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "True enough!"
<p>Amidst the exuberant laughter of the young soldiers, Keiji heard a rough sounding cough. He followed its source.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You hangin' in there, old man?"
<p><strong>Old Soldier:</strong> "Ah, yes. Thank you."
<p>The old soldier thanked Keiji for the bamboo flask of water he offered.
<p><strong>Old Soldier:</strong> "I agree that there's something special about Lord Nobunaga..."
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "You think? If an old vet like you says he's the best, that's a real compliment!"
<p><strong>Old Soldier:</strong> "But you will know the true strength of a lord like him when he is gone."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "What do you mean, gone?"
<p><strong>Old Soldier:</strong> "The sudden loss of a leader both respected and admired by all his troops--"
<p><strong>Old Soldier:</strong> "...There is a rage and a grief there strong enough to overcome any powerful force."
<p><strong>Old Soldier:</strong> "Their morale unbound by the living, his soldiers would bring literal hell in their lord's name."
<p>The old soldier spoke softly, reminiscent.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "But... he wouldn't..."
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "Yeah, what's with the depressing talk, gramps? Don't get us worried, now!"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "You've already got one foot in the grave yourself!"
<p><strong>Soldier 3:</strong> "That's pretty funny!"
<p><strong>Soldiers:</strong> "Hahaha!"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "You and the lads getting pumped?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Hey, Masamune. Thirsty?"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Yeah, get me a cup of the good stuff!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Seriously? Someone's ready to relax--and by relax, I mean snooze!"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "I'm joking with you, lad. Obviously."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Unlike the rest of you! Think it's a good ideea to bet on Lord Nobunaga's death within a league of his hearing?"
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "We weren't really! It was all just talk!"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "...As long as that's all it is."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "If you want to talk about a scary fight, a dead hero coming back to life can do a lot for morale too. On that note--"
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Motonari Mouri's return to the field's got to be a big shot of moxie for his troops. Winning won't be easy."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Feel free to unwind but stay sharp."

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Feel free to unwind but stay sharp."
<p>With that warning given, Masamune left.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...The death and return of a hero..."
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "Pretty sure guys like us have our hands full just keeping ourselves alive!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "C'mon now, I don't wanna hear my vanguard talking like that! You wouldn't let me charge on my lonesome now, will you?"
<p>Keiji's lighthearted tone brought another round of raucous laughter.
<p>......
<p>Several more days passed.
<p>The mountains surrounding the plain that would soon host a great battle were dotted with men and horses.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "My lord."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Our enemy have been cautious in setting up their encampments."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "We've got the Hojo coming from the northeast, and the Miyoshi and Chosokabe coming from Shikoku."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Sounds like fun."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "The Uesugi and Takeda are camped in those mountains over there."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...That's far from the battle. What's their aim? Are they trying to pincer us?"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "In any case, we know they won't be making the first move."
<p>Everyone from the warlords to the lowest ranked soldiers knew that this would be the battle to decide everything.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We will win this war."
<p>Tension and heated emotion filled the area.
<p>......
<p>(It's been a few days since we got on the road. I'm sure Nobunaga's reached the battlefield by now.)
<p>True to his word, Sasuke had no problems getting me out of Azuchi Castle. We boosted a horse and... were now resting.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm sorry we keep having to stop for me."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "This is far from an unnecessary amount of stopping. In fact, I'm impressed at the amount of travel you can fit in a day."
<p>(Not as much as Nobunaga can. We haven't seen a trace of him yet...)

<ul>
    <li>(I can't rest though.)</li>
    <li><strong>(I want to see him soon.)</strong></li>
    <li>(I need him to be safe.)</li>
</ul>

<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I'm rested though, so if you're ready I think we should get back on the road."
<p>(I want to talk to Nobunaga before the battle gets too heated to see him.)
<p>(If we get there before it starts, he'll be in camp. But if he leaves for the front--)
<p>(...Who knows if I'll see him in time?)
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I understand why you're in a hurry but pushing yourself is no good."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I'm afraid if I bring you to the Oda and you're in anything but condition green, my own health will be in danger."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "They wouldn't really kill you if--"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "...Shh! Listen."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hmm?"
<p>(Hoofbeats! And a lot of them!)
<p>(Bandits? Or soldiers?)
<p>(Either way, we can't let them find us!)
<p>Sasuke took my hand and was about to lead me into some tall grass to hide--
<p>...But I stopped at the ringing of what was clearly a prayer staff.
<p>(That sound!)
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "MC!"
<p><strong>???:</strong> "Of all the people..."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "What cause does the Devil King's lover have on an animal trail this far from home?"

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "What cause does the Devil King's lover have on an animal trail this far from home?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Kennyo."
<p>He and his men formed a circle around us, cutting off any escape route we had.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sorry, Sasuke. I didn't mean to get us surrounded."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "It's all right. I've trained for this. More times than you might imagine."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ninja training sounds rough."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Only when you're trying to pass your license exam from moderately awesome ninja to fully awesome ninja."
<p>(I'm so glad Sasuke can keep his sense of humor in situations like these.)
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "I would have thought you would be at the battlefield, at Nobunaga's side."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Yet here you are, in the wilderness, with only one guard. Has he forsaken you?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Our relationship isn't your business."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Hmph. You remain impertinent."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "That is fine. If you do not stand in my way, I see no reason not to spare you."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh. About that--"
<p>(I would LOVE to not stand in your way but we happen to be going the same direction.)
<p>(If he gets to Nobunaga first, there's gonna be a fight and I won't get to talk to him!)
<p>(Somehow, we need to distract Kennyo and sneak away...)
<p>I shot Sasuke a quick look.
<p>Sasuke looked in the direction we'd left our horse, then looked back at me.
<p>He did this weird blinking thing too. Code?
<p>(I'm going to assume that means "You distract him, then we escape on horse together!" Great! Good plan, Sasuke!)
<p>I nodded and turned to Kennyo.
<p>(Now to distract him.)
<p>As I searched for ideas, my mind flitted back to that pink sugar candy--and the color pink reminded me of one person.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I hear you left Ranmaru behind."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "What? Is it casual conversation you seek?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh, I'm just wondering what your reason is for abandoning someone who cares so much about you and even treated you."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You know you can still go back to him."
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "Ranmaru is too weak to walk the path I walk. Why should I go back to him?"
<p>("Weak?!" Hey now, hold your adorable pink horses there, buddy!)
<p>My temper flared when I thought of Ranmaru and how he smiled through his heartache.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ranmaru is not weak!"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "How do you wish me to describe him? I left him because he is too weak to follow me and thus useless."
<p>There was pain in Kennyo's expression; his callous words were clearly hard-won.
<p>(...You don't really believe that. You're just trying to convince yourself.)
<p>(And you really need to stop poisoning your heart with those lies.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "You can leave him behind; you can think he's just going to slow you down or even lessen your resolve--"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...But Ranmaru is doing everything he can to try and bring you happiness."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Because you make him happy! He doesn't want to lose you, even if he's not strong!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "How can you just discard someone who only wants you to be happy?"
<p>I had to say, I felt like I was in Ranmaru's position myself. I was so worked up I'd started to cry.
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...What do you know...?"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You cannot possibly have experienced the kind of hatred that burns your soul every waking moment of your life."
<p>I might not know hatred, but I felt rage.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Okay, you know what you are? Stubborn, that's what! A big, stubborn oaf of a man!"
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "...S-stubborn?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "MC, he's also an armed oaf--no offense meant by the O word, sir--and maybe you should be more careful?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "No, I think he needs to hear this!"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "And I think we've stalled long enough."
<p>(Oh, right! I was distracting him! Oops! Got a bit too into my role!)
<p>Sasuke whistled and our horse came rushing over with a neigh.
<p><strong>Brethren 1:</strong> "Wha?!"
<p><strong>Brethren 2:</strong> "Where were they hiding a horse?!"
<p>Our trusty war steed came crashing into Kennyo's line of men and Sasuke vaulted up upon her with ninja-agility.
<p>He reached down a hand to pull me up.
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "MC!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Sasuke!"
<p>Before I could take it--
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You will not escape!"

<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p><strong>Kennyo:</strong> "You will not escape!"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ah--!"
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...MC...?"
<p>Nobunaga looked up from his map.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "My lord?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I thought I heard her voice."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "You know that MC's still in Azuchi right now?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Yes, of course."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Now then, I believe we should make the first strike, if that is acceptable to my lord?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I see no reason to wait for their attack when we can seize the advantage."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Tell the vanguard to deploy."
<p>......
<p><strong>Oda Vassal:</strong> "You've got orders to deploy!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "And I heard those orders loud and clear! This is what I've been waiting for!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Keiji Maeda's ready for you, but are y'all ready for Keiji Maeda?!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...The rest of you? After me!"
<p>With a flourish of color and panache, Keiji spun his spear atop his horse.
<p>He raced off with a whooping cry that his fellow vanguard echoed.
<p>That dauntless courage of his spread through all who saw and heard him.
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Someone's in good spirits."
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "Only Keiji and the madmen he surrounds himself with would be enthusiastic about the odds we're facing."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "How're things going with the weapons?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "If the question is, are we producing enough gunpowder, then the answer is we're producing more than you."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Why does that sound like a challenge?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...Whatever. Just don't get yourself killed trying to meet it."
<p><strong>Masamune:</strong> "Why's that? Would you cry for me, lad?"
<p><strong>Ieyasu:</strong> "...That's right. Big tears. Of joy."
<p>......
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "What's this now? You didn't think you'd get our lord's head sittin' around here dozing off, did you?"
<p>Keiji thrust the butt of his spear into an enemy soldier's torso, knocking him down.
<p><strong>Enemy Soldier 1:</strong> "Guh!"
<p>The tip came down to finish the job.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Looks like the fighting's breaking out in pockets here and there."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Whos' got the right wing? Is that Masamune? He's sure fighting up a storm."
<p>Keiji gazed off into the distance, only to see a cloud of dust--heading his way.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Is that?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Yo, Oda's scallywag!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Yo, yourself, you shambling corpse! Aren't you in charge of this show? Should you really be greeting the guests?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Ain't that the courteous thing to do? It should be when yer guests are dressed all fancy like you are. Care for a little match?"
<p>Motonari threw up a hand.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Get down!"
<p><strong>Soldier 1:</strong> "Argh!"
<p>Bullets hailed down upon Keiji's troop.
<p>Smoke from the grass revealed the presence of Motonari's [gunmen].
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "...Did you mean match or 'matchlock'?"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Heh, ya got me there! Just like I plan on gettin' you outta the damn way!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "You're a big morale boost to the Oda, so you're gonna have to die first!"
<p><strong>Soldier 2:</strong> "H-how can they cause this kind of damage...?! Lord Keiji, something's wrong!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "What's up?!"
<p><strong>Soldier 3:</strong> "There are a dozen more injuries than the number of men firing! They're small, but--!"
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "...Oh, that? Yeah, that's called a 'shotgun' shell. If ya wanna know more, ask Kicho."
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "Well, ya could if you make [it] outta here in one piece, that is."
<p>Motonari signalled once more--
<p><strong>Underling:</strong> "Urgh!"
<p>But it was another unit who fired that time. And they fired AT the Mouri soldiers.
<p>Groans and shouts of pain came from the grass as Motonari's gunmen fell.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "What the--?!"
<p>Keiji turned around. Behind him, a blue flag with a red sun was flying.
<p><strong>Motonari:</strong> "...Damn Uesugi."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Thank you for that enlightening demonstration on the weapons you've smuggled in, Motonari."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "My lord once gave vital salt to his rival, Lord Shingen. Now you've given us these."
<p>It was the Uesugi's chief strategist and his riflemen who stood backing Keiji up.
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "However, the Uesugi and Takeda will lend our strength to the Oda in this battle."
