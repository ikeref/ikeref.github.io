  <h1>Nobunaga - Sequel - Chapter 1 (6-10)</h1>

<h2>Part 6</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Have I kept you waiting?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Not at all!"
<p>I turned around to see him, my whole body sharing in my joy.
<p>Unable to wait a moment longer, I raced toward him, throwing myself into his waiting arms.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Mmm."
<p>We looked into each [others'] eyes and soon found ourselves lost in a kiss.
<p>It felt at least as long as the time we'd been apart.
<p>(...It feels so good to be surrounded in his scent again.)
<p>Already, I was heating up inside, my thoughts overridden by my desire.
<p>(It was only a few days...)
<p>(...But I've missed him so much...)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Ah... Nobunaga..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Breathing this heavy after just a kiss?"
<p>His eyes narrowed in delight, his large hand encompassing my warm cheek.
<p>Another luxuriating sigh escaped me.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "In lieu of the look you are giving me, I shall spare you the punishment I promised at council."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "And what about you?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...What about me?"

<ul>
    <li>"You missed me."</li>
    <li><strong>"You were lonely."</strong></li>
    <li>Stare back quietly.</li>
</ul>

<p>(I'm talking about your own look. Like you long for the chance to touch me more.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It seems I wasn't the only one feeling lonely. Which makes me glad."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...You were able to tell, I see."
<p>He let out an amused sounding breath.
<p>We kissed more slowly, so that we might make our pleasure last longer.
<p>Our bodies brushed together. A distracting sound reminded me of the guidebook I'd stuffed in my kimono.
<p>(Oh, I almost forgot about it!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Wait."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What is it?"
<p>(Don't look so disappointed now!)
<p>Though him pouting was adorable.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "There's something important I need you to know."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I am listening."
<p>I pulled out the traveler's guide to present to him.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...That was in your bag. One of the items you brought to prove to me you traveled through time."
<p>(He was so distracted by Bearsace I didn't think he'd recognize it!)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "That's right. It's a... mildly trashy record of your era, compiled from various histories."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It has info about you and the others. Details about the Honno-ji Incident when I arrived and what happened after."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Except... everything after the Honno-ji Incident is now blank for some reason."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Let me see."
<p>I handed it over to him.
<p>He flipped through the pages, his expression unreadable.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You are certain there was writing on these pages before?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Absolutely."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I see..."

<h2>Part 7</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I see..."
<p>Nobunaga closed the traveler's guide.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You identified a potential threat in the altered contents of this 'trashy record'--"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Yet you waited until we were alone to report to me, in order to spare the others confusion."
<p>MC:</strong> "Yeah, that was it!"
<p>(Heh. He's so smart.)
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "However, there is something strange about your theory."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What is it?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Why have the pages become blank? Why do they not have differing text?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...You're right. Maybe because history here is still changing?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It is possible. My concern is that your era may be the one experiencing the greatest change."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What are you thinking?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If those who studied history ceased to exist..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...that could explain why there is nothing written in these pages."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "But that would be...a- a massive amount of history to lose..."
<p>(Is that... Is that even possible? What could cause something so dire?)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I think I maybe need to talk to Sasuke about this..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Who is Sasuke?"
<p>(Oops! Info leak.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "He's another person from my era who traveled back in time when I did."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "It's because of him I time traveled at all. He's a researcher who studies time travel."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Why have you never spoken of him to me before?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Because he also... kind of sort of works for Kenshin Uesugi. I'm sorry. I didn't mean to keep it from you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do you have a way to contact him?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Smoke signals? Maybe...? I don't know... Nothing immediate though."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We should keep him in mind."
<p>Nobunaga moved over to his shelf.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "What is it?"
<p>He turned around, and I saw he held Bearsace in [his] hands.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Um, Nobunaga?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Does Bearsace look intact to you?"
<p>(Okay, he said it several times, but I still get this tickle inside whenever Nobunaga says "Bearsace".)
<p>I tried to restrain a smile.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Bearsace is another item from your future, like that book."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Good point."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We should both keep a close eye on him, to make sure nothing concerning has occurred."
<p>(Aww! Nobunaga's taking Bearsace's "health" so seriously!)
<p>I was now failing to restrain a smile.
<p>Nobunaga recognized this, and smiled a daring smile himself.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Do not worry."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I will not allow anything to harm you."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Should heaven and earth and the oceans rise up to swallow you, I shall split them apart to find you."
<p>He shook Bearsace, mimicking a "nodding in agreement" gesture.
<p>(Argh! Nobunaga's being so cool! And he's also being so cute!)
<p>I couldn't help it. By now, I was laughing.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Ahaha!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Why do you laugh?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "B-because... it's like... you're having a conversation with B-Bearsace and...!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Cease laughing."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I-I can't! You're too c-cute!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Then I shall seal those laughing lips."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Mmm..."
<p>He took my chin and drew me near, his lips pressing hard against mine.
<p>The unease I'd been feeling before was gone now.
<p>Right now, all I could feel was love for Nobunaga.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Oh... Nobu...naga..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "No more waiting for either of us."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Though you are a woman worth waiting for."

<h2>Part 8</h2>
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...Though you are a woman worth waiting for."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Don't worry... I won't hold anything back from you any longer..."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Won't you, now?"
<p>Nobunaga kissed down my neck, his lips teasing my flesh; they curved with pleasure as my breath quickened.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I must see for myself."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Be my guest..."
<p>Surrendering myself to my ravenous lover, I closed my eyes.
<p>......
<p>Several days following the attack on Azuchi Castle...
<p>Kenshin and his allies had returned from southwest Azuchi to Kasugayama Castle in Echigo.
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Kanetsugu. Forward."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "My lord."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "I commend you on the recapture of Uozu and your work in Sakai."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Failure isn't worthy of praise, my lord."
<p>Kanetsugu, bowing with his head hanging low, spoke such not to chastise his lord, but himself.
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Even I wouldn't predict the Oda would withdraw following the Honno-ji incident."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "You made the right choice."
<p>Kanetsugu:</strong> "I'm undeserving."
<p>Yukimura; "What happened there, anyway? I remember the Oda attacking the Uesugi defenders..."
<p>Kanetsugu lifted his head.
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "The night before Honno-ji, the defenders took their lives. My decision not to send support was why."
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "...That's... hey, listen..."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "I don't need your sympathy or your advocacy. And neither do they."
<p>Kanetsugu's eyes were ice. Unforgiving. Un-needing of forgiveness.
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "You're right..."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "As always, Kanetsugu's pride is high enough to put Mt. Everest to shame."
<p>Sasuke spoke softly, such that only Yukimura could hear.
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "...You're making that mountain up. Also, I forget you two have dealt with each other for a long time, huh?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "I trained with him when I entered the Nokizaru. So, some four years ago."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Kanetsugu is extremely talented."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "As Lord Kenshin is 'officially' dead, he's currently serving as [the] Uesugi patriarch, Lord Kaekatsu's, tactician and consul."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "But in spirit, he remains Lord Kenshin's right-hand man."
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "He's also got a curious streak."
<p><strong>Yukimura:</strong> "...Is that last bit important?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Sasuke. What have you been whispering over there?"
<p><strong>Sasuke:</strong> "Just some water cooler talk."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "That's a long time to be talking about water..."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "If everyone's ready to move on, I'd like to discuss our plans from here forward."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "First, we need information. I want to know why Azuchi was attacked."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "If the culprit wanted to kill Nobunaga, they did a poor job of it."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Right. If they've got a weapon that can inflict that much daamge from that great a distance, why retreat immediately after?"
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Kanetsugu, what do you think?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "It wasn't a question of armament. Now, if we continue with the belief that Kicho was responsible--"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "...I would think he wants to shake people's faith in Nobunaga's authority."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Do you know why?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "Kicho is running a highly profitable import business in Sakai."
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "It's possible he hopes to profit off the chaos..."
<p>Just then, a voice was heard from beyond the chamber doors.
<p><strong>Uesugi Vassal:</strong> "Excuse my interruption. I have a report for Lord Kenshin."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Enter."
<p><strong>Uesugi Vassal:</strong> "My lord. You've received a request for an audience from a strange merchant."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "What do they want?"
<p><strong>Uesugi Vassal:</strong> "They asked if you have any interest in 'the weapon that destroyed Azuchi's tenshu'?"
<p><strong>Both (Sasuke and Yukimura):</strong> "Uh oh."
<p><strong>Yoshimoto:</strong> "Are they seeking to peddle their destructive weapons that quickly?"
<p><strong>Kanetsugu:</strong> "...No, I don't think so."
<p><strong>Shingen:</strong> "Agreed. There's more to this."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Let this merchant through."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "I'm curious to hear their side of the story..."

<h2>Part 9</h2>
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "Let this merchant through."
<p><strong>Kenshin:</strong> "I'm curious to hear their side of the story..."
<p>......
<p>It had been a brief few days since my return to Azuchi...
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...I didn't think we'd be on the march so soon."
<p>We and the Oda army were on the road to battle. I joined Nobunaga on his horse.
<p>(Okay, that's a lie. I knew we had to put down the rebellions quickly...)
<p>There'd been one dangerously close to the vicinity of Azuchi.
<p>Nobunaga said he would go himself to put it down.
<p>(I recall from the first time he did it how important it is that Nobunaga personally set an example early on.)
<p>I was still worried about him. Though his attitude gave no warning signs away.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Speed is vital in battle."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "The more we dally, the longer our opponents have to prepare."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "My lord is correct."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "That said, a forced march is hard on even seasoned soldiers, so let us know if it is too much, MC."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Thank you. I'm doing all right."
<p>Masamune and Ieyasu departed Azuchito secure their own domains.
<p>Meanwhile, Hideyoshi, Mitsunari, and Keiji were accompanying Nobunaga.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Not even a forced march can get Lord Nobunaga's princess down!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Don't push yourself. Don't let anyone else push you either, MC."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "You hear that, Princess? Your brother over here's worried about you."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "I'm not her brother."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Her dad? Mom? Uncle? Cousin? Neighbor's grandma's nephew's son?"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Stop."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Hahaha!"
<p>Once Keiji got started, everyone around us found something to laugh about.
<p>(Nice of them to keep the mood up so I don't get too nervous.)
<p>I shot a look of gratitude to them, when--
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Eeep!"
<p>I felt the sweet pull of teeth at the tender ridge of my ear, eliciting an embarrassingly high cry from me.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "W-w-what was that for?!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You were getting too relaxed."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Don't go thinking you're going to put on another show in front of everyone!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "And why shouldn't I?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Isn't your ear mine?"
<p>Nobunaga's long fingers tickled their way across the lobe of my ear.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I won it in our game of Go."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Wait, that bet is still valid?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I never said it wasn't."
<p>He smiled wickedly, releasing one hand from the reins to feel my body.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "I still possess this spot... and this... and this..."
<p>My leg, my lap, my lips, my chest where my heart lay. A warm sensation followed his touch.
<p>(I-I think that by contract, I own all of you t-too, but d-darn it... I'm too turned on by him to claim my prizes in turn!)
<p>Instead, I happily let him have his way with me. When I shivered in delight, he whispered softly into my ear.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "You can always challenge me back if you wish to reclaim your body?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...Is that so...?"
<p>I replied with quickened breath, pausing a moment to gather myself.
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Consider the bet on!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Oh?"

<h2>Part 10</h2>
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Consider the bet on!"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Oh?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Always so feisty."
<p>I knew Nobunaga enjoyed it though.
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "So that's how our lord gets when he's feeling jealous? Didn't know!"
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "...It's something, for sure."
<p>......
<p>We rode through the night and reached the stronghold of the rebellious daimyo the following morning.
<p>Inside our hastily erected tent, Nobunaga was surrounded by his warlords.
<p>Just beyond, the army stood ready to move on his command.
<p>(I saw the enemy's watchmen. They must be panicking, given how fast they keep running in and out of the castle.)
<p>(Then again, that's reasonable when you wake up to find Nobunaga parked outside your front door.)
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I expect, having inferior numbers, he has decided to barricade himself within his castle."
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Surprised he rebelled at all, if he was going to turn out to be such a coward."
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "There's lots of ways to end a siege. Flood 'em. Smoke 'em. Starve 'em. Annoy 'em. What do you think?"
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We must set an example for other potential traitors with this first strike."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "We will break don the gates and launch a frontal assault."
<p><strong>All:</strong> "Yes, my lord."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "At the very least, they will not have had time to trap the castle."
<p>Hideyoshi and Keiji left the tent to convey Nobunaga's orders.
<p><strong>Hideyoshi:</strong> "Everyone, we march!"
<p><strong>Keiji:</strong> "Vanguard, you guys are the lucky ones as you're riding with me!"
<p>Keiji lifted his spear high.
<p>The cheers increased in volume.
<p>(But the vanguard is the group that fights at the head of the army. The first to run into the enemy.)
<p>(I don't know if I'd call the ones in the most dangerous position "lucky".)
<p>Yet they seemed to consider themselves so, with every soldier sharing Keiji's fearlessness.
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "Mitsunari, command of the rear guard is yours. Do as you see fit."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Yes, my lord."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "MC, you will remain in camp with Mitsunari."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Nobunaga..."
<p>I caught his eyes before he left for battle. The eyes of my beloved.
<p>......
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "What's dead is dead. There's no point in seeking meaning after the fact."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "If you're going to regret taking a life, it's foolish to do it."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "It's an action you can never take back."
<p>......
<p>...Eyes that would grow colder with each life he was forced to take, reflecting the state of his heart.
<p>It would be a little colder upon his return.
<p>(But I'll still greet you with a smile.)
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "Please be safe."
<p><strong>Nobunaga:</strong> "...I will."
<p>His expression softened a little when I smiled at him.
<p>We exchanged a single, brief kiss before he exited the tent, dashing as ever.
<p>(May he return body and heart intact.)
<p>......
<p>Several hours later--
<p>We were close enough to the fighting that the shouts and screams continued in the background unabated [til] night.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "MC, are you all right?"
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "...As well as can be expected. How are you holding up, Mitsunari? How's the situation?"
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Our swiftness has paid off, and most of the castle has fallen."
<p><strong>MC:</strong> "I see."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "Lord Nobunaga and the others should be returning shortly--"
<p>Just when I as beginning to relax...
<p><strong>Oda Soldier:</strong> "Someone! Come quick!"
<p>I whipped around trying to find the source of the frantic voice.
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "That fire came from the rear guard. We had no indication of an enemy attack."
<p><strong>Mitsunari:</strong> "I have a bad feeling about this. MC, please stay close to me."
<p>(What's going on?!)
